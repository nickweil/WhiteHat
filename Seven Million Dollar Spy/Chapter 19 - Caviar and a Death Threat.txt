Rochford said he knew a great place nearby for dinner.
When they made arrangements to meet, Shcherbakov asked if Rochford minded if he brought someone else along.
"Sure, anyone you want," Rochford said.
"It will probably be the Security Director of the UN mission, the Russian said.
But Shcherbakov seemed to have thought better of his earlier threat to report the FBI approach to the U.N. Mission.
"He showed up alone, and he had a lot to drink," Rochford said.
The Russian was knocking back great quantities of Tullamore D.E.W., the blended Irish whiskey Rochford favoured.
He had a lobster.
At dinner, he got angry again, and started swearing, and complaining about Gorbachev.
"The Muslims will become terrorists without the Russians to hold them in check."
I was agreeing with him, whatever he said.
"The Soviet system is great, from a purely ideological point of view, you're right."
We did breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next week and a half.
We talked about our families.
We had steps forward and steps back.
Still, the Russian had not offered any clue about a KGB source inside American intelligence.
But he confided startling information about something else.
It was after that first night when they met again that the Russian revealed he was under a death threat.
He was working for the Irkutsk mafia, he said, and they had arranged a caviar shipment to New York worth a million dollars.
But the caviar had spoiled enroute.
He was the middleman, and the Russian mobsters blamed him.
He owed them hundreds of thousands of dollars, they warned.
"Pay us the money," they told him, "or we will kill you."
