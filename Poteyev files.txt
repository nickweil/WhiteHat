The Russian-American espionage scandal that broke out in the summer, according to the authorities of the Russian Federation, was the result of betrayal. But unlike the names of ten employees of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), who exchanged the US for four defendants in Russian criminal cases of treason, they did not provide the names of the culprit with the failure of the SVR. "Kommersant" filled this gap, finding out who the traitor is and what the leadership of the SVR can wait for, where, as it turned out, he worked for a long time, supervising the work with illegal immigrants, whom he passed as a result. The investigation was conducted by Kommersant correspondents Vladimir Solovyev and Vladislav Trifons.

Unreal Colonel

"This is the result of betrayal, and traitors always end up badly. They end up, as a rule, either from drinking or from drugs - under the fence" - this is how Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin commented on the biggest Russian-American spy scandal in June. The prime minister did not call the name of the traitor who revealed the Russian spy network to the Americans, although he does not have to doubt that he knows it. Carefully hide the data about the main culprit of the loud exposure of the illegal immigrants of the SVR and in the Russian special services: as soon as it comes to the spy scandal, the security officers fall silent. And Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov asked the Kommersant question about who passed the Russian intelligence officers to the Americans, spread his hands: "I don’t know anything about that."

Any information about a person whom both Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev are called not only as a traitor, the authorities of the Russian Federation protect them with such care as if it’s not a traitor, but a valuable agent. Perhaps the culprit large-scale investigation, which, as found out by Kommersant, began immediately after the failure of the SVR and has not ended to this day. A source who told about it to "Kommersant" reported that "a lot of former and current employees of the SVR" is taking place in the case, and recommended "not to go into this matter".

Collecting data about a traitor was more like intelligence work, rather than a journalistic investigation. Officials who possessed at least some information about him flatly refused to talk on the phone, insisting only on personal meetings. During the correspondence with "Kommersant", they did not change the addresses of their electronic mailboxes one at a time, deleting the letters related to this topic immediately after reading. "We know who he is and where he is. He betrayed either for money, or he was simply caught on something. - "b"), - one of the high-ranking officials of the Kremlin administration answered the question of "Kommersant" and added: "The fate of such a person is unenviable. He will carry it all his life and fear retaliation every day. "

"He", as Kommersant found out, is Colonel Shcherbakov, who for a long time served in the SVR as the head of the US Department of Administration "C" in charge of working with illegal immigrants.

In the "forest" - as the SVR headquarters in Yasenevo is called in slang - they overlooked the fact that Shcherbakov’s daughter has been living in the USA for a long time. "It’s strange why no one was puzzled by the fact that a person in such a post has relatives abroad. This is just one of many questions in this case that the investigation is interested in," the Chekist, familiar with the investigation, told Kommersant. they are also monitored in much less classified structures. For example, there is a case of dismissal from the Security Council of a person whose relative was only going to marry with a foreigner.

The SVR did not suspect anything, even when Shcherbakov abandoned the promotion offered to him about a year before the spy scandal — apparently, in order to avoid the lie detector test required in such cases. This means that he was already actively cooperating with the American special services. In any case, in June, the US authorities reported that they began to monitor Russian illegals ten years ago.

Finally, no one paid attention to the fact that the son of Shcherbakov, who worked in another power department - the Federal Drug Control Service, hastily left Russia, having flown to America shortly before the exposure of Russian agents. The traitor himself, says an informed interlocutor of Kommersant in the Russian state structures, fled the country just three days before Dmitry Medvedev’s June visit to the United States. "After that, the Americans, fearing that we, suspecting treachery, would start pulling out our illegal immigrants from the USA, began arresting them," a source told Kommersant. Medvedev's visit to the States. "

Real Colonel

After the sensational spy scandal, the surname Shcherbakov in the SVR was equated with a curse. And it's not that the colonel surrendered his own, but how he did it. According to Kommersant interlocutors in the Russian special services, he personally helped expose the most valuable and experienced of ten Russian illegal immigrants, 65-year-old Mikhail Vasenkov, also known as Juan Lazaro.

Back in the 60s, Mr. Vasenkov-Lazaro was sent to Spain, from where he left for Chile, where, under the guise of a photographer, he began his work on foreign intelligence. "He takes great pictures - it’s impossible to imitate - and turned his talent into a cover for missions," the intelligence officer said. In search of life under the guise of fashionable photographer Juan Lazaro traveled all over Latin America, simultaneously acquiring acquaintances among politicians and businessmen. Subsequently, his friends and acquaintances were used by the Soviet and then the Russian special services not only to obtain information, but also as agents of influence.

In the 70s, Mikhail Vasenkov married Peruvian journalist Vika Pelaez, and soon after, the newlyweds moved to the United States. It was an authorized relocation on the instructions of the leadership of foreign intelligence. And, apparently, Mrs. Pelaez really was not cunning when, after the arrest, she told the press that she did not know who her husband really was. In the States, the Lazaro family lived modestly, although the spouse of the Russian intelligence officer was an influential journalist from the Spanish-language newspaper El Diario, and among the acquaintances of Mikhail Vasenkov were high-ranking functionaries from the left wing of the US Democratic Party. For successful work on the Soviet special services, Mr. Vasenkov back in the 80s by the secret decree of the leadership of the USSR was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.

The possibilities and connections of the illegal Vasenkov are really impressive. According to one of his acquaintances, Vasenkov-Lazaro once managed to obtain the schedule of foreign visits of the US president for several years ahead. During his stay abroad, he received three higher educations. Already in the United States, when he was over sixty, he got a degree in political science. "During his work, Vasenkov became so naturalized that he almost forgot the Russian language," says the Kommersant source.

Shortly before his arrest, Mikhail Vasenkov was given the rank of general. At the same time, he was officially a pensioner for several years and formally could refuse to work for exploration. But he did not do this.

Vasenkov’s biography — Lazaro was so flawless that, even after arresting him, the American special services were powerless to prove the detainee’s connection with Russian intelligence. Before the investigators sat a gray-haired, respected family man, whose children, wife, numerous friends, fellow students, neighbors, and influential acquaintances were ready under oath to confirm any fact from the life of a respectable 65-year-old American Lazaro. The arrested himself, until recently, denied any accusations, insisting on innocence. Colleagues Mr. Vasenkova admit that in the end he could be free. If one day Colonel Shcherbakov did not appear in his cell.

The circumstances of this meeting, the interlocutors of "Kommersant" describe as follows: "The visitor in Russian called the arrested person his name and last name, rank, place of work, after which he said:" Mikhail Anatolyevich, you must confess and surrender. In response, the arrested person told the guest in English that he did not understand the language in which he speaks. Then the visitor repeated everything in English. But in response I heard: "I’m Juan Lazaro. Everything that happens is a stupid mistake, and I don’t understand what I should confess." After that, Colonel Shcherbakov handed over the Vasenkov-Lazaro case to the Americans, which he brought from Moscow. After the folder with the details laid before the suspect, he called his real name, adding that he did not intend to say anything more.

Investigators, however, nevertheless tried to talk to an illegal, breaking three ribs and a leg during interrogation. With these fractures, he flew to Russia after the exchange of uncovered spies for four defendants in Russian criminal cases of treason against their homeland, which took place in July. Colleagues of Mr. Vasenkov say that, barely returning, he told his leadership that he was not going to live in Russia and was going to go abroad. "It is understandable. After all, what happened is not just a betrayal," they say in the SVR. The only consolation in the SVR is that one of the Russian spies, a military communications officer known as Robert Christopher Metsos, still managed to escape from the Americans in Cyprus. "The man, whose photo was in the hands of all the police, just disappeared.

Debriefing

The espionage scandal has hardly affected the bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington. At least, on their political component. This happened mainly because both the Kremlin and the American White House were equally interested in minimizing the negative effect of this story as much as possible and not in spoiling the "reset". "According to our data, when Obama was reported about the operation being prepared, he personally insisted that he not break the game with the Russians. Therefore, he did not sanction the arrests before our president’s visit there," said a Kremlin official directly involved in negotiations with the US "However, he couldn’t forbid his special services to carry out this work. As a result, the network was covered right after the visit, which, in general, was also a move. But we entered the position of Obama. It can be understood."

Although the arrest of the Russians was painfully perceived by the Russian special services, Moscow sincerely rejoiced when, in exchange for the detained Russian illegal immigrants, the United States, among others, asked the former head of the military-technical and military-economic policy department of the Foreign Policy Research Department of the Institute of the USA and Canada RAS 2007 to 15 years of imprisonment for treason. "Bortnikov (head of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation Alexander Bortnikov. - " Kommersant " ) was very happy about that. The Americans simply burned Sutyagin, and everyone learned that he was really a traitor," says an employee of the administration, Mr. Medvedev.

In order not to annoy Moscow once again, the Americans behaved uncharacteristically for such stories and refused to "shine" the traitor. "Earlier, as it happened? Someone ran away from us - the Americans solemnly announced: Ivan Ivanov is with us, he feels fine and does not need Russian consular assistance," one of the current employees of the Russian special services recalls with Kommersant But that’s not the case with Shcherbakov. The Americans at home are quietly happy that they have shod the Russians, and have noted promotions. And we are clearing debris, conducting internal investigations and inspections."

However, in the Russian Foreign Ministry they say that the scandal only at first glance went smoothly. "In the" forest" they are still so furious that, as far as they can, they torpedo any work with the Americans, even on such an important topic as missile defense," a high-ranking Russian diplomat complains.

Investigation of the failure of the SVR, which is being conducted now with the participation of a number of Russian law enforcement agencies, including the FSB, is called unprecedented by the KGB. "This is a big batch, as a result of which both heads and epaulets will fly," the source "Kommersant", who is familiar with the investigation, notes. According to him, now the conversations that the SVR should be reformed and returned under the roof of the main intelligence service, from which intelligence was withdrawn by the decree of the first president of Russia Boris Yeltsin in the early 90s, have resumed. "The separation of the SVR from the KGB is increasingly criticized. The head of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev is an active supporter of the reverse process ."B" ) ", - said the source" b. "

Rumors about the imminent resignation of the head of the SVR, Mikhail Fradkov, appeared a year ago. But then everything worked out. However, after the June failure, no one undertakes to guarantee that Mr. Fradkov will sit in his chair. According to Kommersant’s information, Dmitry Medvedev, convinced that the arrest of illegal immigrants is the result of betrayal, not an intelligence error, nevertheless said at one of the closed meetings that personnel decisions on the SVR would be taken. "Failure is a reason to think," the Kommersant source quoted by the president was quoted by the president.

However, the Kremlin does not disclose its plans for the future fate of the SVR. Moreover, in October, the Kremlin’s press service announced that the failed spies had been awarded "the highest state awards". The decision to mark the work of declassified intelligence officers in this way was taken personally by Mr. Medvedev, since he considers them to be "talented adventurers." According to Kommersant’s information, some of the exposed spies, and perhaps all of them, received the Order of Courage from the hands of the President. In the description of this award it is said that it is honored by those who showed "dedication, courage and bravery in the performance of military, civil or official duty in conditions associated with the risk to life."

"Defector May Have Been Recruited Years Ago"

November 14, 2010

Senior State Duma Deputy Gennady Gudkov said Sunday that a Foreign Intelligence Service colonel who betrayed 11 sleeper agents was possibly recruited by the United States "several years ago."

"There is indirect evidence that Shcherbakov was recruited by the Americans several years ago and, thus, he was able to prepare his escape, taking files of our agents and even information he might have obtained from other departments," said Gudkov, himself a retired intelligence official, Interfax reported.

President Dmitry Medvedev confirmed Friday that the U.S. arrests of the Russian agents in June was the result of the defection of a senior intelligence official. The defector, identified by news reports by only his last name, Shcherbakov, had headed the Foreign Intelligence Service department overseeing agents in the United States. Kommersant reported that he fled to the United States in June, just six days before the arrests.

U.S. intelligence analyst David Wise told NBC television on Saturday that Shcherbakov must be under FBI protection. U.S. intelligence agencies have neither confirmed nor denied news reports about Shcherbakov.

"Identity of Double Agent Questioned"
https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2010/11/15/identity-of-double-agent-questioned-a3009
November 15, 2010

he double agent who betrayed 11 Russian agents to the United States was a Colonel Poteyev, not Shcherbakov, RIA-Novosti reported Monday, citing an unidentified Russian intelligence official.

"The person to blame for the betrayal is Poteyev, a colonel with the Foreign Intelligence Service who fled to the United States in spring this year," the official said.

The official said Poteyev was under the protection of the U.S. intelligence community and posed a threat to Russian intelligence officers working in the United States.

He said Russian intelligence officials faced an enormous task protecting the identities of undercover agents.

Kommersant, which broke the story last week, identified the double agent as a Colonel Shcherbakov and said his son had worked with the Federal Drug Control Service. The service has denied employing any such person.

But on Monday an agency spokesman told Lenta.ru that Poteyev's son worked for the agency. He declined to elaborate.

President Dmitry Medvedev confirmed on Friday that the U.S. arrests of 10 Russian agents in June was the result of the defection of a senior intelligence official. The 11th suspected agent jumped bail in Cyprus in June.

"Ex-KGB soldier named as double agent who exposed Anna Chapman spy ring"

November 18, 2010

Russian intelligence sources told local media that the traitor who gave away Anna Chapman and nine others was Colonel Alexander Poteyev who served in the KGB's elite 'Zenith' Special Forces unit during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

A criminal case for 'state treason' had been opened against him and he will be tried in absentia like other traitors before him, they said.

The scandal caused huge embarrassment in Russia and triggered the biggest spy swap since the Cold War.

In its wake, President Dmitry Medvedev ordered an internal investigation at the SVR foreign intelligence service, the agency that ran the compromised agents.

Fyodor Yakovlev, a KGB veteran who said he served with Colonel Poteyev in Afghanistan, told the Regnum news agency that he now regarded his former comrade as a "non-person".

"This non-person will live a lonely life until the end of his days in fear," he said. "Lonely because his relatives and loved ones will not be by his side. Either his children will have to alter their appearances or else they will be doomed to the same nightmarish existence as their father."

Colonel Poteyev is believed to have fled to the United States in June through his native Belarus days before the ten agents were arrested in America. He was reportedly deputy director of 'Department S' inside the SVR, the unit which coordinates the work of illegal agents in the United States.

He is reported to have worked in New York in the first half of the 1990s. It was there that the CIA is said to have recruited him, offering him a financial settlement. His wife later became resident in America and his son and daughter moved there before he fled Russia in June.

Initial reports described a man with the same biography but gave him a different name, Colonel Scherbakov, but intelligence sources said that he had fled Russia for the United States years earlier.

Experts believe that details of the betrayal were deliberately leaked to help the Kremlin save face. Being betrayed is better than having your own spies exposed as incompetent, they say.

The scandal also appears to be part of a turf war between the domestic FSB security service and the SVR foreign intelligence service. The FSB is reportedly hoping that the SVR will be so damaged by the affair that it can incorporate it or install its own people in leading positions.

"Russia charges US spy ring 'traitor' Alexander Poteyev"

A former top Russian spy has been charged in Moscow over the exposure of 10 sleeper agents in the United States.

The man, identified as Alexander Poteyev, will be tried in his absence with high treason and desertion, Russia's secret service, the FSB, said.

Russian media say he fled to the US days before last year's scandal broke.

The 10 sleeper agents were expelled by the US and exchanged for four Russians who allegedly spied for the West, in the biggest swap since the Cold War.

Russian intelligence sources have been quoted as saying the affair was a major embarrassment for the Federal Security Service (FSB).

But, on their return, the Russian sleepers were met by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and bestowed with Russia's top honours by President Dmitry Medvedev.

They included Anna Chapman, who has since become a media sensation in Russia.

Directorate C

"The FSB investigative department has concluded its investigation into Russian citizen AN Poteyev," Russian news agencies quoted an FSB statement as saying.

"The indictment was submitted to the Moscow district military tribunal for a hearing on April 21."

High treason carries a maximum of 20 years' prison.

Mr Poteyev was apparently exposed in the Russian newspaper Kommersant last November - though it used the name of a Colonel Shcherbakov.

Russian media say Mr Poteyev was indeed a colonel at Directorate C, a spy agency that placed long-term agents in foreign countries.

"He fled Russia a few days before Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's June trip to Washington and is currently in the United States," an unnamed security official was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency Interfax.

In its report in November, Kommersant quoted an unidentified Kremlin official as suggesting that a Russian hit squad was planning to kill the colonel.

"Defector of the SVR Poteyev continues to betray Russia"
German Alexandrov

May 16, 2011

The Moscow District Military Court (MOVS) began the trial of the former deputy head of the C department of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation, Alexander Poteyev. He is accused of having "handed over" a network of Russian illegal agents to the US intelligence agencies. As a result, this summer, the SVR prohibited its employees and their relatives from traveling to rest in other countries. Poteyev himself continues to supply the Americans with classified information.

Hearings on the case against Alexander Poteyev are held behind closed doors. He was charged in absentia under the articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation 275 (high treason) and 338 (desertion). The materials are reviewed by a board of three judges, the prosecutor is the representative of the Prosecutor General’s Office, and the former SVR employee is defended by a lawyer by appointment. Now the MOVS is investigating the evidence, then the interrogation of witnesses will begin. Poteyev faces up to 20 years in prison. It is noteworthy that the traitor was not on the wanted list. "This makes no sense," the agency’s source in the special services said.

The interlocutor in the SVR itself noted to "Rosbalt" that after Poteyev had fled to this department, the measures for controlling employees had been significantly strengthened. "In particular, there is still checking whether employees and their relatives do not own property abroad," the agency source said. - Owners of houses and apartments abroad immediately fall under suspicion. Also this year, a temporary ban has been imposed on employees and their family members on traveling outside Russia. Previously, it was possible to leave, having received a special permit. However, they promise to cancel the last measure after the end of all checks. "

Poteyev himself, having passed illegal agents, whom he personally supervised, began to supply the US special services with information about the Russian "moles," about which only fragmentary information on the type of service reached him. According to Rosbalt, a former officer of the SVR has named the pseudonyms of intelligence officers, as well as the American departments where they work or receive secret data. More accurate data Poteyev did not know. As a result, the US is now looking for spies in a variety of structures, including the National Security Agency, the Military Intelligence Agency and several departments of the Ministry of Defense.

"The consequences of Poteyev’s flight will be felt for a long time, and the agent network in the US urgently has to be rebuilt, people taken out of the blow, relations with someone are forced to" frozen "for an indefinite period," the agency’s source in the Russian special services said. According to him, the traitor Poteyev actually became under the yoke of members of his family. His wife and daughter loved in the USA, they constantly sought to have a luxurious life, convinced Poteyev to start cooperating with the Americans. As a result, the officer of the SVR, who in recent years often "was put to the bottle", broke down.  

As Rosbalt has already reported, Alexander Nikolaevich Poteyev was born on March 7, 1952 in the Brest Region of the Republic of Belarus into the family of Hero of the USSR Nikolai Poteyev. After the army entered the service in the KGB of the USSR. In the 1970s, Alexander in the Brest region met a girl, Marina, who was a year older. After some time, the young people got married. Soon after, the Poteyev went up, he was transferred to work in the KGB office in the republic, he settled with his wife in Minsk. In 1979, a daughter, Margaret, was born to the Potoyevs. In the same year, Alexander was trained in officer development courses, where he trained personnel for the KGB special forces. Poteyev served in the special group "Zenith", then in the special groups "Cascade-1" and "Cascade-2", took part in operations in the territory of Afghanistan, He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Returning from this country, Poteyev graduated from the Red Banner Institute of the KGB and worked in the First Main Directorate (foreign intelligence) of the KGB of the USSR. In 1982 another family appeared in the family - the son Vladimir. In the 1990s, Poteyev worked in several foreign countries (including the United States) under the guise of an employee of one of the departments of the Russian Foreign Ministry. In 2000, Alexander Poteyev was appointed deputy head of the "C" department, which oversaw the activities of Russian illegal agents.

According to an agency source, Poteyev should have attracted the attention of his colleagues back in 2001. Then his daughter Margarita, a student at the International University in Moscow (created in 1991 by the decision of Mikhail Gorbachev and George W. Bush), was unexpectedly invited to work at the Moscow office of the American Councils for International Education Corporation. After a year of internship in this structure, the girl has already been offered a job in the USA. In 2003, the Poteyevs' apartment in Moscow was attacked, after which the spouse Marina moved to the USA. Women really liked in this country, but always lacked money. In the Russian special services they suspect that the Americans first recruited Margarita Poteyev, and then her father also began to cooperate with them, passing secret information, including about acting illegal agents. And the son of the colonel, Vladimir Poteyev, could well work for the Western special services. In 2005, a man under the patronage of his father got a job at FSUE "Rosoboronexport" (the only state mediator in Russia for the export and import of military-style and dual-use products and technologies).

The Americans, after receiving information from the colonel, established surveillance of Russian agents operating in the United States. They led some of them for five to seven years, supplying them with false information, which then went to Moscow. Americans also almost immediately learned about all the newly arrived illegal agents. Source Rosbalt "assures that for such work Poteyev bought several cottages in the United States, on his special account accumulated a large amount of money.

In 2010, it became obvious to the Russian special services that a high-ranking "mole" operates in their system. However, it was not possible to calculate and grab it. According to Rosbalt, the NER was preparing to test the C control staff for a lie detector that could help identify the traitor. Knew about this and Alexander Poteyev. First, he urgently sent his son to the USA, and shortly before the visit of President Dmitry Medvedev to America in June 2010, he fled himself. He took time off from the leadership to go to relatives in Belarus, from there went to one of the Baltic countries, and then to the United States. Immediately after Medvedev left the United States, it became known that ten Russian illegal agents were arrested in this country, including Anna Chapman. Later they were exchanged for four people who were suspected of spying for the USA and Great Britain in Russia.

A Moscow military district court on Monday found former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Poteyev, who helped U.S. authorities disclose a Russian spy ring last summer, guilty of high treason and sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison.

A Moscow military district court on Monday found former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Poteyev, who helped U.S. authorities disclose a Russian spy ring last summer, guilty of high treason and sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison.

Ten Russians, including media star Anna Chapman, were arrested in the United States in June 2010 on suspicion of espionage. They pled guilty to conspiring to act as unregistered foreign agents and were deported to Russia in exchange for four men accused by the Kremlin of spying for Britain's MI6 and the CIA.

The Moscow Military District Court held that Poteyev’s guilt had been proven. 
"Poteyev uncovered Russian sleeper agents from foreign intelligence services to the United States, he also deserted," the verdict said. 
Poteyev, who was secretly working for the CIA, fled to the United States with his family shortly before the arrest of the sleeper agents was made public. His case was heard in absentia.

According to his lawyer, Dmitry Mikhailov, the prosecution asked the court to recognize Poteyev as guilty of the alleged crimes.
The verdict of the Moscow military district court said that former spy Anna Chapman testified against Poteyev at the trial. Other members of the espionage scandal also bore witness.

The court also deprived Poteyev his rank of colonel and stripped him of his awards. Poteyev’s lawyers plan to appeal the verdict.

"Alexander Poteyev, Russian Intelligence Officer, Convicted Of Betraying U.S. Spy Ring Including Anna Chapman"

June 27, 2011

A senior Russian intelligence officer convicted of working for the United States fled Russia on a train just before the Americans busted his 10 sleeper agents.

Details of Col. Alexander Poteyev's quick escape and farewell text message to his wife – asking her to "try to take it calmly" – were among evidence produced by the court Monday as it found him guilty in absentia of high treason and desertion.

Pinup spy Anna Chapman, one of the 10 agents deported from the U.S. in July, testified during the closed trial that only Poteyev could have provided the information that led to their arrest last summer, Russian news agencies reported, citing a summary of the evidence read by the judge as he issued his ruling.

Chapman testified that she was caught after an undercover U.S. agent contacted her using a code that only Poteyev and her personal handler knew, the reports said. She said she immediately felt during the meeting that something was wrong and called her handler in Moscow, who confirmed her suspicions. Chapman and others were arrested shortly after.

The agents, who were arrested a year ago Monday, were deported in exchange for four suspected Western agents who had been imprisoned in Russia. It was the biggest spy swap since the Cold War.

The Moscow military court sentenced the 59-year-old colonel to 25 years in prison and also stripped him of his rank and state medals.

The court said Poteyev got word that the agents were being rounded up in the U.S. and was in such a hurry to leave Russia that he rushed out of a meeting at intelligence headquarters, the Interfax news agency reported. It said Poteyev fled to Belarus, crossed the border into Ukraine and then moved west to Germany and, finally, on to the United States using a passport in another person's name.

He had no time to say goodbye to his wife and later bid his farewells in a text message: "Mary, try to take this calmly. I'm leaving not for some time, but forever. I didn't want to, but I had to. I will start my life from scratch and will try to help the children."

Poteyev's grown son and daughter reportedly have been living in the United States for years.

His court-appointed lawyer, Andrei Kucherov, said Poteyev's wife believes he is innocent and wants to join him in the U.S.

Mikhail Lyubimov, a veteran Soviet spy, described the court's ruling against Poteyev as "symbolic."

"He must be rubbing his hands together and laughing at that together with his family somewhere in the U.S." Lyubimov said, according to Interfax.

The court said Poteyev had overseen the Russian sleeper agents in the U.S. as deputy head of the "S" department of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.

In addition to Chapman, other agents also confirmed that only he had access to the sensitive information that allowed the U.S. authorities to apprehend them, the RIA-Novosti news agency said.

The court said Poteyev had begun working for American intelligence around 1999-2000 – betraying the agents, their means of communication and financial information. It said Poteyev had sought to hamper the agents' work by forcing them to meet in places that were unsafe and providing them with inferior equipment.

The Russian spies were given a hero's welcome when they returned home, and President Dmitry Medvedev bestowed them with the nation's highest awards in October.

Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a 16-year veteran of the KGB, sang patriotic songs with the spies to celebrate their return. Putin warned in December that traitors come to a bad end and "whatever equivalent of 30 pieces of silver they get, it will get stuck in their throats."

Unlike other members of the spy ring who have stayed out of the limelight, Chapman has basked in the attention. She has stripped down to lingerie for a photo shoot by the Russian edition of Maxim under the caption "For Your Eyes Only," become the new celebrity face of a Moscow bank, joined the leadership of the youth wing of the main pro-Kremlin political party and hosted a TV program.

Anna Chapman wasn't just a member of one of the largest rings of Russian sleeper agents ever rolled up by the FBI.

The 29-year-old former real estate agent, who became a lingerie model and corporate spokeswoman back in Moscow, represented a new breed of Russian spies adapted to the post-Cold War world.

While the deep-cover agents didn't steal any secrets, an FBI counter-intelligence official told the AP that the spies were making progress to their ultimate goal. They 'were getting very close to penetrating U.S. policy-making circles' through a friend of a Cabinet official. 

FBI representatives did not name names of any Cabinet officials involved, but Russian spy Cynthia Murphy of Montclair, N.J., provided financial planning for venture capitalist Alan Patricof, a political fundraiser with close ties to Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

At the time that the case broke, Secretary of State Clinton's spokesman issued a statement as an attempt to distance Mrs Clinton from the spy ring. 

'There is no reason to believe that the Secretary of State was a special target of this spy ring,' her spokesman said.

The group of Russian spies, including Murphy, Chapman and fellow ring member Mikhail Semenko, were all technically skilled and able to work comfortably in a Western culture, doing so using their own names.

The spy ring was able to blend into American day-to-day life by working respectable jobs and assimilating easily into Western culture, just as Semenko did with his position at a D.C.-area travel agency.

They 'were very tech-savvy, very intellectual,' said C. Frank Figliuzzi, FBI assistant director for counter-intelligence, adding that Semenko is fluent in five languages, including Chinese.

Both of the new-breed operatives used state-of-the-art wireless computer communications, including burst transmitters that sent encrypted messages by radio in a fraction of a second.

Meanwhile, the older spies in the 11-member ring fell back on techniques that have been used for centuries: invisible ink, handoffs of money called 'brush passes,' and forged documents.

Like Soviet sleeper agents before them, they worked under false identities, called legends, some of them stolen from dead people.

All the veteran operatives had undergone years of intensive training in Russia to pass as ordinary Americans. But with the fall of the Iron Curtain and with open borders, someone in Moscow seems to have realized that training may no longer be necessary.

With the two different approaches, one time-tested and one state of the art, 'the Russians were experimenting,' said Mr Figliuzzi.

Mr Figliuzzi's comments came Monday as the FBI released tapes, video and documents that offered a window into the bureau's surveillance, which stretched over a decade.

According to a written surveillance report, an FBI agent watched Chapman buy leggings and hats at Macy's. Later, cameras caught her roaming a department store while a Russian diplomat waited outside.

A surveillance video taken the day before her arrest shows Chapman sitting in a coffee shop with an FBI agent posing as her Russian handler.

Other ring members were shadowed during meetings by a Queens pay phone, in a Brooklyn park or during a stroll around New York's Columbus Circle.

The FBI says seemingly mundane pursuits often served as cover for the exchange of encrypted messages or the transfer of cash, all with the long-range goal of penetrating the highest levels of U.S. policy-making.

The FBI watched the ring operate so intensively for so long, Mr Figliuzzi said, that the bureau was able to penetrate the ring's communications network to the point where U.S. agents were able to pose as Russian intelligence officers.

'So in a sense we began to own their communications' and Chapman and Semenko came to believe that the undercover FBI agents were their Russian handlers.

The FBI released the material to The Associated Press in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The investigation was code-named 'Ghost Stories,' and the release of documents on Halloween- a coincidence.

The linchpin in cracking the case, apparently, was Col. Alexander Poteyev, a highly placed U.S. mole in Russian foreign intelligence, who betrayed the spy ring even as he ran it.

He abruptly fled Moscow just days before the FBI rolled up the operation. Poteyev's role emerged when a Russian military court convicted him in absentia for high treason and desertion. The FBI did not comment on the Poteyev case.

Called 'illegals' because they took civilian jobs instead of operating with diplomatic immunity inside Russian embassies and military missions, the spies settled into quiet lives in middle-class neighbourhoods and set about trying to network their way into the worlds of finance, technology and government.

What appears to be a family photo of one spy, Donald Heathfield of Cambridge, Massachusetts, shows him graduating from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2000. The school revoked the degree a month after the FBI rolled up the spy ring.

The operation's codename, Ghost Stories, stems from a number of the spies using a technique known among counter-intelligence investigators as 'dead doubles' — taking the identities of people who have died. Tracey Lee Ann Foley, Michael Zottoli, Donald Heathfield and Patricia Mills all used the technique, Figliuzzi said.

The U.S. traded the 10 Ghost Stories spies arrested by federal agents for four Russians imprisoned for spying for the West at a remote corner of a Vienna airport on July 9, in a scene reminiscent of the carefully choreographed exchange of spies at Berlin's Glienicke Bridge during the Cold War.

While freed Soviet spies typically have kept a low profile after their return to Moscow, Chapman became a model, corporate spokeswoman and television personality. Heathfield, whose real name is Andrey Bezrukov, lists himself as an adviser to the president of a major Russian oil company on his LinkedIn account.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev awarded the 10 freed spies Russia's highest honours at a Kremlin ceremony.

The case was brought to a swift conclusion before it could complicate President Barack Obama's campaign to 'reset' American relations with the Kremlin, strained by years of tensions over U.S. foreign policy and the 2008 Russian-Georgian war. All 10 of the captured spies were charged with failing to register as foreign agents.

An 11th suspect, Christopher Metsos, who claimed to be a Canadian citizen and was accused of delivering money and equipment to the sleeper agents, vanished after a court in Cyprus freed him on bail. 

The FBI released surveillance photos of Metsos on Monday.

Mr Figliuzzi said Metsos travelled into the U.S. to provide the other illegals with money. Security measures after the September 11 terrorist attacks meant he could no longer risk carrying large amounts of cash, prompting the Russians to send officials already in the U.S. to meet with the illegals and pay them.

That could have made the spies more vulnerable to discovery, since governments generally keep a close eye on the movements of foreign diplomats.

Former Soviet intelligence officials now living in the West scratched their heads over what Russia hoped to gain from the sleeper ring.

'In my view this whole operation was a waste of human resources, money and just put Russia in a ridiculous situation,' said Oleg Kalugin, a former KGB major general who spied against the U.S. during the Soviet era, in an interview earlier this year. He now lives near Washington.

Alexander Vassiliev, a former KGB officer and journalist who has written extensively about Soviet spying in America, said the illegals were supposed to act as talent spotters and scouts, identifying Americans in positions of power who might be recruited to spill secrets for financial reasons or through blackmail.

Spies with the protection of diplomatic credentials would handle the more delicate task of recruiting and handling the agents.

Moscow's ultimate aim, Mr Vassiliev said, was probably to cultivate a source who could provide day-by-day intelligence on what the president's inner circle was thinking and planning in response to the latest international crisis. But he said there was no evidence the Kremlin made any progress toward that goal.

'How are you going to recruit someone like that, on what basis? That's quite a successful person. Why should he spy for the Russians? I can't see any reason,' said Mr Vassiliev, who now lives in London.

Russian Foreign Intelligence Service not commenting on Poteyev's possible death in U.S (Part 2)
http://interfax.com/newsinf.asp?id=686542
July 7, 2016

The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) has declined to comment on a report that former SVR officer and defector Alexander Poteyev died in the United States.

"We are not commenting on these reports," SVR spokesman Sergei Ivanov told Interfax on Thursday.

Former Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Col. Alexander Poteyev, who fled to the United States and was sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison for high treason, died, sources familiar with the situation told Interfax.

"Some reports indicate that Poteyev died in the U.S. This information is now being verified," one of the sources said.

Another source confirmed that such reports had been received from abroad and did not rule out that "this can be misinformation so that the traitor would be simply forgotten."

Poteyev's treason led to the exposure of a group of Russian sleeper intelligence agents working abroad.

"A Traitor Poteyev Could Go Deep Underground"

It became known about the death of Alexander Poteyev - an ex-employee of the foreign intelligence service who was responsible for the work of our illegal immigrants in the United States, who passed CIA Anna Chapman and another nine intelligence officers and was sentenced in absentia in Russia to 25 years in prison for state treason. Rumors of "Moscow's revenge" are groundless, experts say. 

On Thursday it became known about the death of the former colonel of the Russian foreign intelligence service Alexander Poteyev. "According to some information, Poteyev died in the USA. Currently, this information is being verified, "one of the Interfax sources said. 

As a result of the betrayal of the ex-Colonel SVR Poteyev, a group of illegal Russian illegal intelligence agents, including Anna Chapman, was revealed abroad. Recall, the exposure of a group of Russian intelligence officers in the United States occurred in the summer of 2010. The US Department of Justice announced the arrest of 10 people suspected of espionage in favor of Russia, and declared another wanted person. 

In June 2011, Poteyev was convicted. He was found guilty under two articles - treason and desertion - and was sentenced in absentia by the Moscow District Military Court to 25 years in prison. The court also deprived Poteyev of his military rank of colonel and awards. The mechanism of the traitor’s "work" was announced in court. 

Poteyev revealed to CIA agents mechanisms for financing Russian intelligence officers abroad and channels of communication with them. According to the case file, the convict, having access to the list of agents operating abroad, in 2010 issued them to the CIA - he did this during foreign trips and during meetings in Moscow. 

The revealed scouts, in particular, Anna Chapman, said that at the suggestion of Poteyev they were followed from the very beginning. It was also pointed out at the trial that the United States, which had helped the traitor to flee, continued to patronize him. 

"I do not comment on such things," Anna Chapman told the newspaper VIEW. The Foreign Intelligence Service also did not comment on reports of Poteyev’s death. 

Georgy Sannikov, a veteran of foreign intelligence service of the KGB, in an interview with the newspaper VIEW did not rule out that Poteyev "could have gone deep underground ... A person wants to dissolve, get a completely different name, imitate death ...". In turn, foreign intelligence colonel Mikhail Lyubimov in his comment to the VIEW newspaper noted: rumors of Poteyev’s death were "hardly misinformation, there have never been such cases". 

"At many, the roof goes, or" get into the bottle" 

"I'm still more inclined to think that this is really a real death," Nikolai Kovalev, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, former director of the FSB, told the newspaper VIEW. - If the United States included a witness protection program, it would be easier for them to announce that he was missing, or simply not to mention, to have plastic surgery on him and issue a passport to another name and thus hide from information attack, control by bloggers, journalists , public opinion. 

The life of a traitor is not a sweet thing, the interlocutor remarked: "A lot of people have a roof going, either "get into the bottle," or they sit on drugs, and all this ends very badly for health." Kovalev did not rule out that Poteyev could be sick already here in Russia, the Americans offered him some kind of treatment, he hoped that he would be cured, and this prompted him to betrayal. But this is again one of the versions. 

From Afghanistan to New York Alexander 

Poteyev is the son of Nikolai Pavlovich Poteyev, a professional soldier who received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union in 1944 for the destruction of nine fascist tanks. 

At one time, Alexander himself, who, after serving in the army, graduated from the KGB Minsk school, distinguished himself in the war in Afghanistan. As part of the special groups of the KGB "Kaskad" and "Zenith", he visited this country several times, received the Order of the Red Banner and several medals. 

Upon completion of work in Afghanistan, he graduated from the Red Banner Institute of the KGB of the USSR, he worked in the First Main Directorate (PGU) of the KGB, which was engaged in foreign intelligence. Career continued in the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of Russia, where Poteyev was promoted to deputy head of the C department responsible for the work of illegal intelligence officers in the United States. He headed the 4th (American) department of the SVR. 

The work in this direction was begun even when Poteyev was sent to the USSR Embassy in Washington. Since 1995, Poteyev has been at the Russian Permanent Mission to the UN in New York. 

The flight of "citizen Dudochkin" 

Poteyev began to issue secret information from 1999-2000, from the time he got access to it — RIA Novosti reported this, quoting Poteyev’s sentence in 2011.

The CIA controlled Russian agents for a long time, not stopping their activities, but limiting the fulfillment of goals, as a result of which their work was ineffective in the absence of errors. 

According to Kommersant, before his flight overseas, Alexander Poteyev was able to ship to the USA and employ his spouse, daughter, and son. By the way, Vladimir Poteyev’s son, a graduate of the International Institute in Moscow, has worked at Rosoboronexport since 2005. Poteyev Jr. moved to the United States shortly before the exposure of the "Chapman-Lazaro-Pelaez group."

By the time of her escape, Poteyev’s wife had been living in the USA for a long time, stated the Interfax source in power structures immediately after the news of the scout’s flight. According to the source, "these circumstances that accompanied the flight of a traitor, of course, aggravate the gross miscalculation of our special services." 

In the spring of 2010, Poteyev, taking leave to visit his relatives in Belarus, moved to Ukraine, and from there he was transferred by CIA officers first to Germany and then to the United States. 

At the same time, he used a fake passport in the name of citizen Dudochkin. Dudochkin, a real-life person, was questioned in court and said that he had not lost his passport. However, according to him, in 2009, he passed the passport to the US embassy for visa. 

"Mary, I'm leaving forever" 

It is curious that, judging by media reports on the trial of Poteyev, the defector’s spouse Marina, not only testified at her husband in a Russian court, but, in fact, became a key witness. 

Marina Poteyev reported that her husband took leave from the meeting in the SVR due to poor health. He told his wife that he was going on a business trip to Belarus, and the next day he sent her an SMS message: "Mary, try to take this news calmly, I'm leaving not for a business trip, but forever. I did not want this, but it happened. I will start life all over again. Children will be helped if they accept it, please do not turn them against me." 

The witness explained that after this message she did not receive any information from her husband. He left his IDs, passes and stamps at home. 

Seven years before the flight of the father of the family, a strange incident occurred in the life of the Poteyevs. On January 25, 2003, Marina turned to the police with a statement that "three unknown persons, posing as police officers, entered her apartment, threatening with two pistols, tied her husband, Poteyev Alexander Nikolaevich ... and his son, Poteyev Vladimir Alexandrovich - a student go course MMU. Then, according to Marina, the attackers abducted $ 3,300 from an apartment and escaped. A number of media outlets citing sources in the Foreign Intelligence Service reported on an assumption: the attack could have been staged by agents of the American special services who demonstrated to the "client" that he was not protected, despite a responsible post in Russian foreign intelligence. 

Opened "ten" 

At the end of June 2010, the US Department of Justice reported the arrest of 10 people suspected of spying for Russia. Moscow noted that the spy scandal was "promoted" several days after Dmitry Medvedev's visit to the United States - at that time the Russian president. 

The website of the Justice Ministry reported: the defendants, who in quotes called "Richard Murphy" and "Cynthia Murphy", lived in New Jersey near New York. Vicky Pelaez and Juan Lazaro were also arrested in Yonkers near New York. "Anna Chapman" was arrested by the FBI in Manhattan. The accused "Michael Zottoli" and "Patricia Miles" were arrested in Arlington, Virginia - a suburb of Washington. Mikhail Semenko was also arrested there. "Donald Howard Hisfield" and "Tracy Lee Ann Foley" arrested in his apartment in Boston. The accused "Christopher Metsos" is still at large, according to the US Justice Department. Later, Metsos, whose true name was never disclosed, was detained in Cyprus, released on bail of 27 thousand euros and disappeared.

Anna Chapman, 28, is one of the defendants in the "Russian spies" case arrested on Tuesday in the United States. In total, ten people were accused of espionage in favor of Russia in this case.

Uncovered Russian intelligence agents were initially charged with money laundering. Later, a number of defendants in the case were accused of using fake documents, including for penetrating government circles. The scouts were accused of transmitting information to the SVR using the classic spy technique - disappearing ink, shortwave transmitters and using the ex

Already on July 8, 2010 the trial took place. Nine suspects admitted that they were citizens of Russia (the tenth - Vicky Pelaez - originally from Peru), and confessed to secret activities in the United States.

The largest exchange since the Cold War

The Washington Post, commenting on the process of "Russian spies", suggested that the capture of the "dozens" was nothing more than a prelude to the most large-scale exchange of revealed "moles" since the Cold War.

And indeed, such an exchange occurred. Already on July 7, 2010, it became known that Moscow and Washington had reached an agreement on exchanging the "dozens" for persons serving sentences in Russia for espionage and similar crimes.

For our part, the person involved in the espionage scandal, military analyst Igor Sutyagin (now working at the British Royal Joint Institute for Defense Studies), ex-colonel of the GRU Sergey Skripal (convicted of espionage in favor of the UK), as well as former SVR Colonel Alexander Zaporozhsky, which, as reported, could be involved in a loud spy scandal - the failure of the FBI officer Robert Hanssen. In addition, Gennady Vasilenko, a former employee of the KGB of the USSR, ex-deputy head of security of the NTV Plus TV company, was transferred to the US side. He was convicted of illegal possession of weapons and an attempt to manufacture an explosive device.

Exchange also recalled the times of the Cold War. On July 9, 2010, in the far corner of Vienna Airport (traditional "neutral territory"), airplanes from Moscow and New York landed at the same time, after which the "espionage bridge" was again "divorced".

On this plane from the United States flew to Vienna so-called. "Russian spies". He should take and take to America deported from Russia Igor Sutyagin and other prisoners sentenced in Russia for espionage

After the mandatory "quarantine" somewhere in the Moscow region of the revealed Russian illegal immigrants met Vladimir Putin - at that time the Prime Minister of Russia.

"30 pieces of silver will stick in the throat"

In December 2010, Putin, answering one of the questions during a straight line, touched on the topic of espionage scandal - while using strong expressions.

"As for the traitors, they will be bent, I assure you, because ... Here is our last case of betrayal, when they gave out a group of our illegal immigrants. These are officers, you see, officers! A man betrayed his friends, comrades in arms - these are people who put their whole lives on the altar of the fatherland. What is it - to learn the language at the level of the mother, refuse relatives, not be able to come to bury loved ones! Just think about it! "

"A man devoted his whole life to serving the motherland, and there was found some kind of brute that betrays such people! - furiously continued the prime minister to stigmatize the traitor. - How will he live with this all his life ?! How will he look into the eyes of his children, pig ?! No matter what, and whatever the 30 pieces of silver these people receive, they will stand in their throats with a stake, I assure you. Hiding all my life, not being able to communicate with loved ones ... You know, a person who chooses such a fate will regret it a thousand times more. "

"Chapman considers it Poteyev man who passed it"

A number of media outlets, in particular Kommersant, reported in November 2010 that the traitor in the SVR, who issued the top ten, was a certain Colonel Shcherbakov - it was stated that he was the former head of the US Department of Management "C" illegal intelligence.

The name of Alexander Nikolaevich Poteyev surfaced later. In particular, in June 2011, Anna Chapman gave testimony at the trial in the case of Colonel SVR. The foreign intelligence officer reported (her story was quoted by RIA Novosti): in the first months of her stay in the United States, work went smoothly, but since April 2010, communications failures began.

According to Chapman, at the same time a man met her who called the password and asked to meet with her. At the meeting, he gave her an illegal passport, which Chapman supposedly was supposed to hand over to another person. At about the same time, an employee of the SVR noticed spying. "Analyzing the situation, including interrogations at the CIA, she concluded that she had been followed from the first days of her stay in the United States. She thinks that Poteyev is the person who passed her on to the US intelligence services, "said a statement about Chapman’s testimony.

"Nobody will eliminate it"

In the possible death of Poteyev, there is no "revenge" on the part of our special services, veteran foreign intelligence officer Georgy Sannikov emphasized in his commentary to the VIEW newspaper.

"In the distant past, even under the Soviet Union, all this was categorically prevented," said the source. He is convinced that in the 21st century, the elimination by the special services is something from the realm of fantasy.

"No one will eliminate it. Why eliminate it - he is a traitor, let him suffer and die from such a state in which they have been around for many years. This is their business, and this death is morally painful, "Sannikov noted.

As for the rumors that have now gone, that he was killed, "the hand of Moscow - Putin once said something", they remain just rumors, agrees to the retired foreign colonel Mikhail Lyubimov. "We have saved all our traitors and have not eliminated anyone: they live and get on. Prosper Victor Suvorov (Victor Rezun), writes books, flourishes (Oleg) Gordievsky. Everybody shouts that they are about to get a kick, although even I have the address of Gordiyevsky, "the source said.

"I would like at least one publication to give an example of liquidation by the special services not under Stalin, but during the post-Stalin period. I do not know a single case. They all lived beautifully, someone was hiding, someone was not, "said Lyubimov. According to him, "who needs now Poteyev? Relations with the USA are getting better, a serious political game is going on in Europe ... and then someone will eliminate Poteyev? "

The anti-Putin press is likely to make a fuss, an expert suggests. However, in international politics this event will rather be ignored. "He died and died, he is not so young, and at the same time he survived so much, he probably stole a lot of money," noted Lyubimov.

"It is clear that there will be an increased interest in his death"

Information about death, of course, must be rechecked, notes Nikolai Kovalev, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, former director of the FSB, in his comments on VZGLYAD. There must be a body, an autopsy, the conclusion of pathologists about the causes of death, and this is not concealed.

"It is clear that there will be a heightened interest on the part of the press, the public ... His doctors-pathologists are unlikely to go to the criminal act and give some kind of fake conclusion about the causes of death. This is severely punished in the United States, and not only there, "Kovalev added.

He believes that "the thesis about a certain Russian trace, long hands, which Moscow has extended to the United States, will be used once again." A vivid example of this is the terrorist attack in Istanbul, although Russia did everything to prevent this terrorist act, for 13 years we have been seeking the extradition of the organizer of this terrorist act. The same situation with the terrorist attack on the Boston Marathon, recalled the source.

He noted that intelligence officers in many countries of the world are in fact known. "There is a golden rule - the family of an intelligence officer is inviolable," Kovalev stressed.

"It is only a special service to go this way, there will be a chain reaction. It is only in one case to prove involvement in the murder, it can cause irreversible processes, war will begin between the secret services, who will quickly eliminate the greatest number of "enemies", the source said. He recalled that the main task of any intelligence officer in any country is to find out whether something is threatening the security of his country. "What is the threat to the security of another state where it works?" It is not as such. He is primarily engaged in ensuring the security of his homeland. And in this sense, to be drawn into this war of extermination is nonsense. The twenty-first century is a policy of common sense, and the special services do not use such methods, "Kovalev concluded.

"Is This American Spy Dead? Or Was He Ever Real?"
Michael Weiss
https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-this-american-spy-dead-or-was-he-ever-real
07/09/2016

Images of J. Edgar Hoover and encased spy paraphernalia are scattered throughout. At centre stage, when you walk in, is a scale-model replica of the JFK hangar where the 1978 Lufthansa heist—the one Martin Scorsese dramatized in GoodFellas—took place. Off to the left is a roped-off and perfectly in-tact commercial airliner wheel, which was recovered from wreckage of the former World Trade Center. As you move along the far-left wall of the room, you notice that there hangs an object somewhat out of place in such recognizable memorabilia of criminal notoriety. The designer handbag, the casual visitor to the G-men’s shrine is reliably informed in a written plaque and accompanying photograph of its former red-head owner trotting along the streets of Manhattan with it slung over her shoulder, once belonged to Anna Chapman.

The most famous of the Russian "illegals," or undeclared agents of a foreign government, busted by the FBI in 2010 as part of a long-running, 10-person ring operating in the United States under the supervision of the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Chapman has since become a different kind of fashion icon in her native Moscow, a sex kittenish runway model and advert pinup celebrated for her Bond girl activities in the world’s financial capital. She was also arguably the least dangerous spy of a network collared in June 2010 and subsequently traded for three agents who’d been working for either the CIA or MI6, plus one Russian nuclear specialist who, while not privy to classified intelligence, had nonetheless been imprisoned in Russia for 11 years on espionage charges.

"Cynthia Murphy," or Lidiya Guryeva, of Montclair, New Jersey, for instance, worked at a lower Manhattan-based accounting firm, not far from the FBI field office, that offered tax services and had a venture capitalist client with close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton. "Donald Heathfield," or Andrei Berzukov, sold strategic planning software to U.S. corporations, putting him in a position to conduct industrial espionage. (The family life of Heathfield and his spy-wife "Tracey Foley," or Yelena Vavilova, which allegedly included a plan to recruit their Canadian-born sons to work for the SVR, inspired the hit Reagan-era Cold War series The Americans.)

Known within the FBI as "Operation Ghost Stories," the SVR illegals case was both sensationalized by the tabloid press—mostly thanks to the pouty and curvaceous Chapman—and downplayed by the Obama administration, then still in final stages of carting out its ambitious "reset" policy with Moscow, which had been running some of the illegals since before the collapse of the Soviet Union when the SVR was still the KGB.

Back in Russia, however, one man was blamed for exposing this deep-cover and decades-long operation on U.S. soil—actually, two men. The first was known only as "Colonel Shcherbakov," who was said to have headed the SVR’s Department S, which ran the illegals program. On Nov. 11, 2010, Kommersant reported that Colonel Shcherbakov had outed his sleeper assets to the Americans. "We know who and where he is," an unnamed "senior official in the Kremlin administration" told the newspaper. "He betrayed them either for money or simply because he had been caught doing something. But have no doubt—a Mercader has already been sent after him," referring to the Stalinist agent who assassinated Leon Trotsky in 1940 after infiltrating the latter’s inner circle in exile in Coyoacán, Mexico.

But five days later, on Nov. 16, Kommersant re-reported that the alleged human source behind Operation Ghost Stories. It was the former deputy head of Department S, Colonel Aleksandr Poteyev.

At his 2011 trial in absentia for treason and desertion in Moscow District Military Court, Poteyev was described as a 59-year-old decorated veteran of the Soviet-Afghan War who began working for the CIA in 1999, a year before joining Department S. According to Kommersant’s write-up, he took "took 12 short trips to the United States, Mexico, Chile, and other Western countries" beginning that same year, at which point the FBI started its long-term surveillance of the illegals on U.S. soil. It waited a decade to arrest them in order to gather a gold mine of information on the behavior and activities of SVR sleepers and ensuring that no valuable intelligence ever got passed back to Moscow Center, as the SVR headquarters is known. But the timing of its arrest was intriguing.

In May 2010, Poteyev apparently requested a week’s leave to travel to Odessa to "see his lover," the mother of his illegitimate child. The SVR denied the request. Then, on June 24, just three days before the FBI closed the net around the 10 illegals, he purchased a rail ticket to Minsk and, using his brother’s passport, traveled onward to Ivano-Krankivsk, Ukraine. From there, he flew to Frankfurt and was picked up and delivered to a CIA headquarters. While in Belarus, Poteyev, according to the Moscow District Military Court, texted his wife: "Mari, try to take this calmly: I’m not going away for a while, I’m going away forever. I did not want to, but I had to. I will start a new life. I’ll try to help the children." In August 2011, the court delivered its sentence: 25 years, even though Poteyev was long gone from Russia.

The entire trial, and its treatment in the not-exactly-independent Russian press, raised a host of questions. Was Poteyev actually the mole in Department S who compromised his own assets? Who was Colonel Scherbakov and why was he first floated as the mole? Did Poteyev even exist or was he an elaborate face-saving invention by Russian government to elide or obfuscate the real breach? As one U.S. intelligence source with close working knowledge of Operation Ghost Stories told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity, the FBI case was "the biggest counterintelligence success in U.S. history. The public statement from the American side was that it ran for 10 years. Now, 99 percent of foreign spies arrested in the United States are caught from either electronic intercepts or a human source. The FBI never stated the basis upon which it made these arrests."

So if Poteyev was real and the FBI’s man on the inside, was his hasty June departure from Russia the result of his fearing that he’d been exposed? And was that the reason that the feds opted to move in against the spy ring just days later?

Another theory was that Anna Chapman caught wind of her own cover having been blown and this precipitated the FBI’s source to defect. Chapman, in fact, testified at Poteyev’s trial, identifying him as one of her handlers. She said that a strange person called "Roman" had called her on her secure means of communication, knew her password and code language, and tried to arrange a meeting in at a New York Starbucks. She duly informed Moscow Centre and it confirmed that her suspicions of infiltration had been correct.

For the last six years, the world had pretty much forgotten about Aleksandr Poteyev. But on Thursday, July 7, Russia’s news agency Interfax reported that the SVR’s most notorious traitor had died in the United States. Interfax did not disclose its sources for the claim, citing them only as "informed." One, however, told the agency that news of the spy’s death might be "disinformation" aimed at having him "simply forgotten," without clarifying if this planted tale emanated from the American or Russian side. As of this writing, there has been no independent Western confirmation of Poteyev’s death (or of his life, for that matter), only regurgitations of the Interfax item and follow-ups by other Russian outlets. The SVR had no comment when asked about the matter. Aleksandr Khinshtein, a Duma MP and writer on Russia’s security organs, told Moskovsky Komsomolets, rather implausibly, that Poteyev couldn’t have been killed by Moscow because Russian intelligence has not conducted any foreign assassinations since Ukrainian nationalist and Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera in 1959 and that a policy against such was established in 1961.

As with everything about this tenebrous spy story, Poteyev’s supposed expiry raises more questions than it answers. Assuming he even existed, did he die of natural causes or of foul play, perhaps after having been discovered and executed by the "Mercader" alluded to by that anonymous senior official in the Kremlin?

One named senior official in the Kremlin who seemed to second the menacing fate awaiting Poteyev in his adoptive country was one Vladimir Putin. During his annual live telephone Q&A, on Dec. 17, 2010, the then-prime minister was asked about the traitor who betrayed the illegals. As he often does with respect to those he violently hates, the former KGB lieutenant colonel resorted to fenya, the slang of the gangster or hardened prisoner:

"As for traitors, they will croak on their own, I assure you. This latest treason case of ours, when a whole group of our illegals were betrayed. These were officers, do you understand, officers! The man betrayed his friends, his comrades at arms—these are people who placed their whole lives on the altar of the fatherland. What does it mean to study a language to native level, to renounce your relatives, not to have the opportunity to come and bury your loved ones! You just think about that!

"The man gave his whole life to service of the motherland, and some brute was found who would betray such people! How can he live with that his whole life?! How can he look his children in the eyes, the pig?! No matter what 30 pieces of silver these people received there, they will be a stake in their throat, I assure you. To hide their whole lives, not to have the opportunity to talk to their loved ones… You know, a person who choses such a fate will regret it a thousand times!"

Which certainly sounds like a veiled threat of assassination, particularly coming from the man whom a British inquiry found "probably approved" the 2006 murder of former KGB officer turned British informant Alexander Litvinenko in central London. But even if the Russians could find Poteyev, who would be living somewhere in the United States under FBI and/or CIA protection, would they take the bold decision to eliminate him?

Russian defectors living in the United States tend not to fear for their lives as they do elsewhere. The most well-known example in recent decades is that of Sergei Tretyakov, the SVR colonel who ended up working for U.S. intelligence for three years while serving as the deputy rezident at the Russian Mission to the United Nations, on East 67th Street in Manhattan. Before defecting in 2000, he handed the Americans "thousands of SVR top-secret diplomatic cables and hundreds of classified Russian intelligence reports," his biographer Pete Earley wrote in Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia’s Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War. As a result, Earley told me, Tretyakov was well taken care of until his death in July 2010.

"The CIA has a formula where they figure out how much these people are due," Earley said. "It’s a secret formula but they go through what this person delivered, what the value is, and they assign a monetary amount to that. Then they cut a cheque." Tretyakov reportedly got a record payment of more than $2 million. And despite rumors that he may have been the source for Operation Ghost Stories, Earley insists that his subject never knew any of the illegals. He did, however, feel safe enough to list his name in the phone book. "Sergei was only given a security detail when he traveled abroad. He felt like his American citizenship protected him."

Oleg Kalugin, once the head of KGB operations in the United States and now the highest-ranking former KGB officer living here, agrees that if Poteyev were indeed under U.S. protection, he’d be fairly immune to the sort of retaliation Putin or his Chekist minions may have intimated. "In my lifetime—and I’m still alive and kicking—there have been no political assassinations performed by the Russians or Soviets on the territory of the United States," Kalugin told me. "I think he died a natural death."

Kalugin insists that whatever the dark romanticism of tradecraft depicted in The Americans or the perceived absence of Cold War rules as to who could be killed, the reality was more regulated and prosaic. "The United States is the main enemy, so to speak, and to do something of this nature on U.S. soil would have serious repercussions." Litvinenko was a different matter because of his chosen country of exile. "Had Poteyev been in Europe, he’d have been dead a long time ago. Europe is a different story and it can be handled." Kalugin laughed, perhaps recalling his own experience in foreign assassinations. As the former head of the KGB’s foreign counterintelligence, or K Branch of the First Chief Directorate, Kalugin has long maintained that he was present when the murder of Bulgarian dissident Sergei Markov was planned. Markov was fatally poisoned by a ricin pellet injected by an umbrella into his thigh while he was walking across Waterloo Bridge in London, in 1978. (The order had come down from Todor Zhivkov, the head of Bulgaria’s Communist Party; Markov was assassinated on Zhivkov’s birthday.)

The problems Russian defectors face in the United States are, most observers of the species agree, more quotidian than the overhanging fear of being poisoned or irradiated. Here The Americans, with its emphasis on Russian spooks navigating the complexities of life in an alien and hostile society is instructive.

"The same motivations that make a person to try to leave their country and their cause create some inherent instability in people," the well-connected intelligence source familiar with the details of Operation Ghost Stories told me. "The emotional, financial disruption to your life. The impact on your family. The cultural disparity. Both the CIA and the FBI spend a great deal of time in handling that transition. It’s a lifetime commitment. If a defector was a lieutenant colonel or a colonel, he’d receive a salary commensurate with that of a retired U.S. officer of the same rank. He’ll get healthcare accommodations, a vehicle, assistance with buying a home. And it’s not just money alone. It’s known that the CIA has helped multiple generations of a single family, helping children of defectors get into college, and so on. It’s a far more thoughtful process than perhaps it seems on the surface."

Andrei Soldatov, the coauthor of The New Nobility, a book about Russia’s resurgent spy services, thinks that the most plausible explanation for Poteyev’s death notice appearing first and exclusively in the Russian press means that the alleged SVR officer was the Ghost Stories mole and gave up his own ghost without any outside interference. "The Americans likely passed on this information to his relatives left in Russia, and the information that was intercepted. Then the Russian secret services decided to seize the opportunity to send a message—that it always ends badly when you defect."

Of course, sometimes Moscow Centre will create an opportunity where none spontaneously arises. It is characteristic to see the efflorescence of disinformation in the Russian or Western media about high-value intelligence defectors.

A major double agent was Dmitry Polyakov, a major-general in the GRU, or Soviet military intelligence. According to Earley, the Russians planted a fake news item suggesting that one of Polyakov’s sons was so distraught about life in America that he took his own life—a doubly painful provocation given that Polyakov’s decision to work for Langley in the ’60s is believed to have owed to the Soviets’ refusal to allow his ailing eldest son to receive a life-saving surgery in a New York hospital. The boy ultimately died. "I know both of his remaining sons," Earley told me. "Neither of them committed suicide. This was designed to suggest that defectors have horrible lives."

As for Poteyev, even some of his former colleagues doubt that his obituary is a ruse. Russian Senator Igor Morozov, a former intelligence officer, thinks the staging of Poteyev’s death doesn’t make sense. "No one needed him, to design an operation supposedly for his liquidation," Morozov told state-run news outlet RIA Novosti. "That’s too much honor for Poteyev."

Most recently, a coroner ruled that blunt-force trauma caused the death of a Kremlin insider, Mikhail Y. Lesin, 57, in a Washington hotel room last year, not the heart attack his colleagues first said. In July, the Russian Interfax news agency reported that Aleksandr Poteyev, 64, an intelligence officer accused of defecting and betraying a ring of Russian spies living undercover in American suburbs, had died in the United States.

[Excerpt]

When a suspected hit man for Russian intelligence arrived in Florida about four years ago, F.B.I. surveillance teams were alarmed.
The man approached the home of one of the C.I.A.’s most important informants, a fellow Russian [Poteyev], who had been secretly resettled along the sunny coast. The suspected hit man also traveled to another city where one of the informant’s relatives lived, raising even more concerns that the Kremlin had authorized revenge on American soil.

At F.B.I. headquarters, some agents voiced concern that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, himself a former intelligence officer known to reserve scorn for defectors from their ranks, had sent an assassin to kill one he viewed as a turncoat. Others said he would not be so brazen as to kill a former Russian spy on American soil.

Ultimately, the Russian defector and his family remained safe. But after the poisoning in March of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer living in Britain, and his daughter, American intelligence officials have begun to reassess the danger facing former spies living in the United States, according to current and former American intelligence officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified operations.

[Excerpt]

Mr. Urban does not settle on one theory as to why Mr. Skripal, a relatively obscure figure, was targeted for such a spectacular attack. But one theory in the intelligence world is that Russian hit men were unable to locate their first choice — Col. Aleksandr Poteyev, deputy head at the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service’s American section, who in 2010 blew the cover of 10 Russian undercover spies living as Americans.

The C.I.A. spirited Mr. Poteyev out of Russia in July 2010 — the very week that then President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia had visited Washington for a smiley public meeting with President Barack Obama — and then broke the news to Moscow that 10 of its undercover spies had been betrayed by a Russian officer.

Mr. Putin, as a young man, had served in a role similar to Mr. Poteyev’s, providing support to undercover agents stationed abroad. He seethed with anger when asked about the betrayal, at one point saying at a national news conference, “How will he be able to look in the eyes of his children, the pig?”

Mr. Urban suggests that Russian intelligence services may have had trouble finding Mr. Poteyev, who had been resettled under an assumed identity by the F.B.I., and then “moved down the list” to other former agents deemed traitors who were easier to find — like Mr. Skripal, who

Chapter 14 - Calm Before the Storm

Shortly after Jack’s birthday present of Hanssen-on-a-stick, Gennady’s old friend, the source known as AVENGER,* who may have provided the final nail in the coffin of Jack’s SE colleague Rick Ames and who had been living temporarily in the US, was arrested in Moscow. Said to have been paid $2 million by the US for the Ames information, the fifty-year-old AVENGER and his wife had lived for a while in Haymarket, Virginia, then in Cockeysville, Maryland, where, sources say, the CIA had bought them a house for $980,000, then another for $400,000, in 2001. In Maryland, AVENGER ran a company called East-West International Business Consulting from his home. Although he said he was a consultant, some perceptive neighbors thought he was a spy (or at least he was suspicious), while one thought he was a pornographer.

AVENGER had been lured back to Moscow in 2001 for what his wife said he thought was a KGB reunion. Before leaving the US, he met with Mike Rochford and another agent for lunch in Virginia. Both agents tried to warn the asset, saying that his identity was included in one of the files given to the Russians by Hanssen just a year earlier. "He refused to believe us and returned anyway," Rochford says. AVENGER was arrested on arrival at the Moscow airport.

"The evidence was so well documented," the Moscow Gazeta reported of AVENGER’s subsequent 2003 trial, "that judges sentenced the traitor to two years longer than the prosecution demanded," for a total of eighteen years. It was not the last the world would hear of AVENGER. Seven years later, in 2010, his actual name would surface and be forever linked to Gennady Vasilenko, when one man’s disclosures would play a critical role in the fates of both AVENGER and Gennady. In fact, they would inadvertently save Gennady’s life.

Following the United States’ Stepanov success and the AVENGER loss, another former KGB officer made himself—and his files—available to US intelligence. According to both Russian and US sources, that officer was forty-nine-year-old Minsk native Aleksandr Nikolayevich Poteyev. Having risen up through the KGB ranks, Poteyev went on to serve in Russia’s new SVR, the Foreign Intelligence Service, where he was assigned to New York in the early 1990s. It was during his New York stint that he is believed to have been recruited by the CIA. After he rotated back to the Yasenevo Center, he was eventually promoted to the post of deputy director of the SVR’s Department S, which runs spying operations in the United States. There at the Center, like Stepanov and so many other Russian spies who feared a looming nationwide economic depression under Putin and the oligarchs, Poteyev stashed away his own espionage nest egg.

Sometime in 2001, Poteyev cashed in, allegedly to the tune of between $2 and $5 million, when he tipped the Americans to ten of his US-based Russian agents living deep undercover with false identities, at least two of whom had maintained their "legends" for sixteen years by that point. Known as "Illegals" in Russian espionage parlance, these sorts of deep-cover agents, who blend in seamlessly with the target country’s citizenry, are a Soviet/Russian trademark. They are considered "illegal" because they are unregistered with the host country’s state department or interior ministry, which is the agreed-upon rule among hostile intelligence services. The Illegals program was initiated after the 1917 Russian Revolution, when the new Soviet Union was not formally recognized by other nations, and thus had no diplomatic cover available. The few trainees accepted into the program, culled through many hundreds of aspirants, were subjected to what the New York Times described as "grueling training, psychological screening for a life of isolation and stress." Soviet Party Chairman Leonid Brezhnev pointed out that only the most stoic, brave, strong people, without any weaknesses or defects, served in the program. In 2015, Lieutenant General Vadim Alekseevich Kirpichenko, who headed the program during the 1970s, described the pressures on the Illegals to the Espionage History Archive, saying, "It’s one thing to become someone else for an evening or a theatrical season. And it’s something totally different to turn into someone who once lived or a specially ‘constructed’ person, to think and dream in another language and not think of oneself in the real dimension. Therefore we often joke that an illegal going out into the operational arena could already be given the rank of people’s artist." In the Russians’ scheme, Illegals, who were never allowed to meet one another, would only activate in the event of war or a pre-war crisis, when diplomatic ties are severed and the "legal" Russian rezident spies from diplomatic missions are forced to leave. In that eventuality, the Illegals would handle the local contacts normally handled by the rezident spies; otherwise, they remained in deep hibernation, specifically ordered to refrain from recruiting assets or any other spying activities that could blow their cover. If a crisis never occurred, the Illegals could live their entire lives without taking on an assignment.*

Chapter 17 - The Reset Red Button

Internal objections aside, in 2009 Panetta hosted Fradkov at the CIA’s Langley headquarters. Afterward, they had dinner at the acclaimed Embassy Row organic eatery Restaurant Nora, where Fradkov uttered an unending series of incoherent Soviet-style platitudes that left both Panetta and his chief of staff Jeremy Bash dumbstruck. "What the hell was that?" Panetta asked Bash later as they walked to their cars. In 2010, Fradkov reciprocated as host, showing Panetta and Bash around the Center at Yasenevo. Panetta then met his FSB counterpart at Lubyanka, where Jeremy Bash whispered to him, "I think I can still hear the screams from the basement." It was a reminder that the trip was taking place under extraordinary circumstances that only the Americans knew about. The Musketeers were also unaware of certain developments in the world of espionage and how they were fomenting a chain of events that would ideally lead to Gennady’s freedom.

What was going on? Just prior to his Russian excursion, Panetta had received intel that threatened to upend whatever diplomatic progress had been made up to this point: in the ongoing nine-year FBI surveillance of the Illegals, called Operation Ghost Stories, things were heating up. The FBI had been quietly watching the Russian plants since Aleksandr Nikolayevich Poteyev had given them up in 2001, and in the spring of 2010, the Bureau learned that some of the Russian spies were planning to return to the Motherland. FBI sources add that there was more to the heat-up, but those details are still secret. However, it is widely believed that Russian intelligence had ordered the Illegals to escalate their espionage activities—with special attention to various federal institutions, like the CIA and the State Department—before returning to Moscow. The change in operational status became a political conundrum: Should the US allow the Illegals to leave and share all their intel and inside knowledge with their bosses, or arrest them and derail the reset? 

Panetta briefed President Obama in February 2010 about the broad strokes of the Illegals story, triggering weeks of meetings at the White House about how to proceed. On June 11, Panetta again informed Obama and the National Security Council, convincing them that the arrests should be made and the reset would survive. Although the Obama administration worried that the much-hyped reset might be re-reset in the wake of the Illegals’ arrests, they hoped such a reversal might be averted by instantly proposing a swap, in place of a scandalous trial that would embarrass the president’s new best buddy, Medvedev, who would arrive in the US in a mere two weeks. The arrests had not been planned to facilitate a trade, but since the Bureau had concluded that the spies hadn’t yet caused serious injury to US security, it was determined that Washington, and the reset, could benefit more from using them for barter than as prisoners to be locked up for years. Obama and Panetta agreed to the plan. Fortunately, the FBI’s Alan Kohler, who had moved on from the Washington Field Office and was now chief of the Russia unit in the New York Field Office, had had a detailed swap contingency plan in the works as far back as 2004. Soon the Bureau and the CIA would learn whether the Russians would agree to the swap.

On June 24, after productive meetings on trade with US businessmen in California, Medvedev arrived in Washington and met with Obama.* "Russia belongs in the WTO," Obama said as the two leaders stood side by side in the East Room, smiling after several hours of meetings. Obama then took Medvedev and Vice President Joe Biden for hamburgers at one of the president’s favorite burger joints, Ray’s Hell Burger. Later that day, before returning to Moscow, Medvedev traveled to Toronto for a G20 Summit, content with the results of his US diplomacy. Yet those living in the shadow world made moves that would have removed any and all smiles from the faces of the Russian contingent.

On the very same day that Obama and Medvedev grabbed the headlines, SVR colonel Aleksandr Poteyev, the man who had betrayed the Illegals nine years earlier, was quietly exfiltrated to the US and resettled with a new identity. Leaving his wife, Mary, behind, the fifty-eight-year-old Poteyev fled through his native Belarus and was placed under the protection of US intelligence agents.

"Mary, try to take this calmly: I am leaving not for a short time but forever," Colonel Poteyev wrote in a text message sent to his wife as he fled Russia. "I did not want this but I had to. I am starting a new life. I shall try to help the children." It is known that one daughter, Marina, lived in the US. It was later learned that Poteyev had used a stolen Russian passport and identity ("Victor Dudochkin") to facilitate his travel to the US. The Russians located the real Victor Dudochkin, who explained that when he had previously applied for a US visa, he had turned over his passport to the US Embassy in Moscow while the visa was being processed. The Russians concluded that CIA agents stationed in the embassy had made a copy of Dudochkin’s passport and given the forgery to Poteyev for his escape. It is believed that Poteyev was paid as much as $5 million in return for his files.

On June 27, 2010, within minutes of Medvedev’s plane leaving Canadian airspace, and with Poteyev safely ensconced in the US, the FBI rounded up the Illegals. It was an anxious June 26 phone call, monitored by the FBI, between Illegal Anna Chapman and her KGB father that supposedly prompted such a quick seizure. In the call to Moscow, Chapman had voiced suspicions that she might have been "made." An FBI plant inside the Illegals’ clique had requested a face-to-face meeting with Chapman earlier that day—it was something that was just never done; previously, all contact between Illegals and their controllers had been through encrypted private computer networks only. Gennady says the consensus today is that the Illegals should have known much earlier that they were being watched. "They were enjoying life in US too much and had lost their vigilance," he explains.

Chapter 18 - End Games

In June 2011, the Moscow District Military Court found Aleksandr Poteyev, the man who had sold out the Illegals, guilty of high treason and desertion and sentenced him to twenty-five years in prison in a trial that, like Gennady’s, was closed to the public. His wife was called as a witness. One of the other witnesses who testified against Poteyev was Anna Chapman. She told the tribunal that she had become suspicious of him after an undercover FBI agent contacted her in New York using a secret code word that only Poteyev would have known. At the time, Poteyev had been stationed in Moscow overseeing the Illegals operation. In addition to treason, the military court found Poteyev guilty of desertion. He was sentenced in absentia to twenty-five years in prison and stripped of his medals, military rank, and pension. Poteyev was not present at his own trial because he had fled Russia shortly before the Illegals were arrested in June 2010, relocating in the US, where he was given a new identity. According to one unverified Russian news service, Poteyev passed away in July 2016.

"The Skripal Files"
Mark Urban

Chapter 14 - Operation Ghost Stories

It is mid-afternoon in Manhattan and a Russian agent named Anna Chapman is meeting her contact, *Roman. He has contacted her by phone and requested the meeting. Chapman, who has been in America for several months, has been making her reports back to the Centre via a laptop. Each Wednesday she has sent her material by a simple expedient almost undetectable in a modern city. She has gone to a cafe or restaurant and established a connection with another computer, one belonging to Russian intelligence people sitting nearby. Her file, encrypted, naturally, has been copied across to their machine by private wireless network without the operatives ever speaking or even necessarily seeing one another.

But there have been some problems with the transfers and Roman is sitting face to face with her. They discuss whether she should take the laptop back to Moscow with her – she’s due to make a trip in a fortnight – or whether he should take it to be checked out. Roman also tells her there’s another reason he has asked for the meeting. ‘There is a person here who is just like you, OK?’ he explains. ‘But, unlike you, this person is not here under her real name … I have documents for you to give her tomorrow morning.’

He produces a fake passport and gives it to Chapman. ‘This is not her real name, but you can call her this name if you wish.’ Roman describes the procedure for meeting the other agent, complete with holding a magazine so she can recognize Chapman as the courier. The woman who is coming to collect the passport will ask, ‘Excuse me, but haven’t we met in California last summer?’ Chapman’s reply was to be, ‘No, I think it was the Hamptons.’

There are certain indications that Chapman is a little suspicious of Roman, and she is right to be. On the indictment covering these events he is described as UC-1, short for undercover 1. UC-1 is an FBI agent.

Two and a half hours later, on the same day, 26 June 2010, and in a different city, another Federal agent, UC-2, is playing the role of a Russian handler too. His conversations involve Mikhail Semenko, a bright young Russian professional holding down a job in the Washington DC area. This encounter has also been engineered by the FBI, starting with a meeting on the street in which UC-2 asked Semenko whether they had met in Beijing. Like the New York conversation, these two started by discussing recent covert communications before the FBI man moved on to ask the Russian to do something for him.

Passing an envelope with $5,000 in it, UC-2 asked Semenko to take it the following morning to a hiding place under a bridge in a park in Arlington, Virginia. Another Russian agent would then collect it. Surveillance cameras record him leaving the money in the place described.

These encounters with Chapman and Semenko marked a closing chapter in one of the longest and most elaborate counter-intelligence operations ever mounted. The FBI code-named these interrelated investigations Operation Ghost Stories, and on 26 June 2010 a carefully choreographed drama was playing itself out.

By that day, after more than a decade of watching, caution was being thrown to the winds. The FBI was taking big risks in a final play. Using details of previous meetings between Chapman, Semenko, and their controllers that they had gleaned from surveillance, they engineered the rendezvouses of 26 June in such a way as to get the two spies, step by step, to incriminate themselves. The FBI was demonstrating that these two had regular contact with Russian handlers from the SVR foreign intelligence service, and that they were ready to take active steps to support deep-cover spies, or illegals, who had taken years to embed themselves in American society.
The trigger for this climatic phase of Operation Ghost Stories was the news that Colonel Alexander Poteyev, a senior SVR officer working for the Americans, had reached Minsk in Byelorussia the previous day. From there he was taken by the CIA into Ukraine and then to the US. This exfiltration had been full of tension, because when he requested a passport to travel overseas, Poteyev had been refused. He had only been able to make the train from Moscow to Minsk by using a fake travel document. And if his rescue didn’t make things complex, and tense enough, there was another major moving part to this operation’s final stage.

Just as the CIA asset was escaping Moscow, Russia’s president, Dmitri Medvedev, was being feted in Washington by President Barack Obama. Protocol required some acting of a high order from Obama. Two weeks before Medvedev’s arrival in America, the US president had received a detailed briefing about the Ghost Stories investigation. At this and a subsequent National Security Council meeting the principals had agreed the phased approach for bringing the whole matter to a head, but at the same time avoiding the presentational car crash of arresting a Russian agent network while that country’s leader was in the US.

POTUS took his honoured guest out for some proper American food at Ray’s Hell Burger, a crowded lunch stop over the river in Arlington. There they each had a cheeseburger, shared the fries, and Obama urged his visitor to watch out he didn’t get the juices on his tie. Making their way back to the White House, the two men made all of the diplomatic noises you’d expect.

‘It’s a pleasure to be here with my friend and partner,’ Obama began, then pledged, ‘The United States wants to be Russia’s partner as [Medvedev] pursues his vision of modernization and innovation in Russia.’ Economic summits followed, more talk of cooperation naturally at the G8, then they flew up to Toronto for the G20 meeting. The FBI had been given its signal, once the Russian leader was out of US airspace, to up the tempo in their operation to dismantle an SVR espionage operation that had taken years of effort and millions to construct.

The actual takedown had to wait until Medvedev was on his plane home from Canada. Craig Fair, one of the senior officers in CD1, the FBI counter-intelligence section running Ghost Stories, later explained, ‘We wanted to wait until he was out of this hemisphere to effect the arrests because it would not be proper to have that done during an international economic event.’

Poteyev, it is clear, had been an extraordinary agent. At the subsequent ‘in absentia’ trial held in Moscow, it was claimed that he was recruited in 1999. Western intelligence people suggest that was about right. The Russian had spent his career in Department S (sometimes called Line S), which ran the ‘illegal’ deep-cover operations considered the most sensitive and prestigious part of the former KGB’s work. Poteyev’s decision to spy for the Americans was the third and final of the betrayals I have alluded to in previous chapters because not only did it spawn this enormous, long-lasting Federal investigation, but it would also produce Skripal’s opportunity for freedom.

The ‘illegal’ agents were spies operating in a Western country, with a false life or ‘legend’, pretending in this case to be regular suburban Americans. Naturally for each SVR officer engaged in this deep-cover work there were several others needed to support them. This might involve delivering money or communications kit to dead drops or preparing the false identities that illegals used. In addition to their working legend, each of these prized operatives could return to Russia (usually every three years), for a few weeks’ leave and to see their families. These journeys usually involved going via two or three other places, changing identity on each leg of the journey, another administrative headache for the officers assisting them. These ‘enablers’ were usually posted under diplomatic cover, serving Line S sections within a rezidentura. Other officers in the station collected political or technical intelligence, each operating in their own silo, knowing nothing about the illegals.

Poteyev was working under cover at the Russian mission in New York when he offered his services as a walk-in to the FBI. At the time, he had been tasked to support some illegals in South and Central America, but returning to the US on a subsequent tour, in a more senior post, he had oversight of Department S operations in the Americas as a whole.

When he went back to Moscow, Poteyev was promoted to Deputy Head of Department S, giving him detailed knowledge of SVR illegal operations globally. From the FBI and CIA’s point of view, he proved to be a quite astounding long-term asset.

The network revealed, bit by bit, to the Americans consisted of four couples. By June 2010 they were located in New York, Boston, and Washington DC.

The oldest of the illegals, *Juan Lazaro, had begun his work overseas thirty-four years earlier in Peru. He relocated with his Peruvian wife to New York in 1984. By the time arrests were drawing close, Lazaro had been living a double life for so long that, Western intelligence officers told me, he had actually succeeded in retiring from the SVR, who were content for him to stay put in the US. Many in Department S, indeed, regarded this as a perfect career for an illegal; to blend in so completely that you never left, so neighbours or colleagues never asked awkward questions.

Another of the couples watched by the FBI for at least six years prior to their arrest had arrived in the US after ten years of building up their legend, living in Canada and France.

These agents were the product of a remarkable investment by the KGB then SVR. Their training in Russia – both spycraft and attempts to perfect a foreign language to near-native proficiency – could take five to ten years. Add to that periods spent in third countries building up their false identities and you could have someone who had devoted fifteen to twenty years to becoming an operational illegal. Naturally, in this drawn-out process, there were quite a few failures or people who simply quit, adding further to the expense of the whole Department S operation.

Even in 2010, though, this type of spying still held a special place in Russian intelligence history and culture. Some of the greatest heroes of the KGB and GRU, like those who’d gained the secrets of the atom bomb or warned of Hitler’s plan to invade Russia, were illegals. During the Cold War such agents were regarded within the KGB as the most ideologically sound, since they were living lives of plenty in the West, something that many Soviet citizens might have dreamed of, but never forgot their true loyalty.

Many years after he became leader, it emerged that Vladimir Putin’s 1980s KGB work in East Germany had been as a Department S officer, supporting illegals.

‘I know what kind of people these are,’ recalled Putin, ‘these are special people, people of special qualities, of special conviction, with a special character. To give up their life, their nearest and dearest and leave the country for many years, and to dedicate one’s life to the Fatherland, not everyone is capable of doing that.’

After the Cold War, it amazed many Western intelligence people that Russia still bothered with such deep-cover operations. After all, increasing amounts of information were obtainable over the internet, an invention which also made it far harder to invent a past life for your operatives. And while 1930s Russia had access to revolutionaries from all over the place, people who actually were native speakers of other languages, the characters sent to the US in the 1990s and 2000s were Russians who, in a few cases, never quite lost their accents.

The illegal network, like the GRU’s caches of weapons for saboteurs, was evidence of the unreformed nature of Russia’s agencies. These were after all preparations for war, one part of Department S’s role being to provide an alternative presence to the officers in embassies if these were forced to leave in time of conflict.

Instructions to this spy ring intercepted by the Americans indicated its main mission, deriving from the Centre’s preoccupation with infiltrating what they termed the country’s ‘ruling circles’, the concept itself being a Marxist holdover. They thus gravitated towards academia, think tanks, or the financial world. In this way, it was hoped, they would be able to mix with State Department, CIA people, or bankers, even if their own false identities were never well enough established to join the Federal government themselves.

What did they achieve? The Russian press would later claim exotic recruitments on their behalf, but the Americans suggest that whenever the undercover Russians got close to anyone in possession of real secrets, they acted to disrupt any actual recruitment. FBI agents would have a discreet word, and the American would quietly break contact. All of this was possible, of course, because Poteyev’s intelligence had allowed them to stay one step ahead of the undercover SVR officers, keeping them under surveillance for years.

Many times during this long investigation the officers in the CD1 section at the FBI, the agents masterminding it, had to ask whether the time had come to reel in the Russians. They had to consider not just the diplomatic ramifications but also, steeped in the Bureau’s law-enforcement traditions as they were, what kind of case they might actually bring to court. A senior FBI agent told me:

They’re hard cases to make. Just because you’re able to charge someone doesn’t make it a winnable case. With the Russians we were trying to improve the relationship and you know there’ll be consequences. Thinking beyond a conviction was really tough on that case.

Add to this the fact that their disruption of the Russians’ activities had prevented any actual disclosure of secrets (or so the FBI always insisted) and the problem of building something that would stand up in court became harder still. With matters moving to a head in 2010, they added Chapman and Semenko to the file. These two, who had not been long in the US, were not actually illegals at all but ‘Nocs’, the term American intelligence types use for those under Non-Official Cover. While they had been successfully entrapped on 26 June, the same was not true of the illegals, where the FBI cases depended more on their use of fake documents, money-laundering statutes, other bureaucratic violations, and a US law against being an ‘unregistered agent’ of a foreign country.

There was another factor also underlying the timing of any arrest, which was that it could not happen while Poteyev was still in Russia. During the years of Ghost Stories surveillance, his safety was an absolute priority. As for what brought matters to a head, early in June 2010, it is not completely clear. It may be that Poteyev felt he was under suspicion and triggered his own extraction or that for reasons we do not yet know the CIA advised him to leave. However, if officials are to be believed, it was a simple professional judgement within CD1 that might finally have tipped the balance of the decision. The operation had gone on for over a decade and consumed considerable resources, after all. It was known that both Chapman and one of the illegals were planning imminent trips back to Russia and the FBI didn’t want to lose them. Furthermore, intelligence had reached the CIA that *Christopher Metsos, a Department S officer who had run missions into the US a few years before to support illegals, happened to be in Cyprus. If they could get him too, then the evidence linking the others arrested to the SVR would be stronger as surveillance had shown Metsos delivering money to them in America during 2001 and 2002.

Having taken the decision to proceed much more aggressively, the FBI moved against Chapman and Semenko, in a bid to entrap them, so matters moved to their crisis. Sensing something wrong, Chapman had rung her father, a former KGB general, who advised her to go to the New York police and hand in the fake passport given to her by Roman. It could be an American ‘provocation’ designed to compromise her, so best play a double bluff. The next day she turned up at the NYPD’s 1st Precinct to do just that. By then the word had been given by Bureau headquarters to arrest the whole network.

On the afternoon of 27 June, *Donald Heathfield and his wife *Tracey Foley were relaxing at their home in Cambridge just outside Boston. It was a Sunday and they’d been out for lunch at an Indian restaurant to celebrate their son Tim’s twentieth birthday. He and his brother were upstairs when there was a knock on the front door.

Moments later teams of FBI agents poured into the house. Hearing the commotion Tim stepped onto the landing to see his parents being cuffed and walked out to waiting cars. An agent told him they had been arrested for being ‘unlawful agents of a foreign government’.

The events in Boston were just one part of a coordinated global operation. In New York and Washington DC the other arrests were going down. Metsos was picked up in Cyprus also.

The following day, 28 June, an MI6 officer confronted a man on a street in Madrid. He had been living in Spain for the best part of twenty years under the legend of *Harry Frith. The Spanish government, it seems, did not want to arrest and try Frith, but they were willing to allow an attempted pitch by the British. A transcript of the MI6 man’s offer was subsequently passed to a journalist.

‘If we do not talk now then I’m afraid there’s going to be a big problem for you here in Spain,’ the SIS officer explained, ‘I work for a Western special service and you work for Russian special services. I know this is a shock and I’m sorry that I have to do this on the street but it was the only way I could get to talk to you securely.’

Frith denied everything, telling the Briton that he was mistaken. But the next morning he fled Spain, never to return. Perhaps, once he was over the initial fright of the encounter on the street, he had rationalized that if the Spanish were willing to arrest him that’s what would have happened already. Metsos too managed to slip the net, disappearing after a bail hearing in Cyprus.

But in the United States, the FBI had ten people in custody: seven deep-cover Russian agents, Lazaro’s Peruvian wife, and the two Nocs, Chapman and Semenko. The interrogations began. Derek Pieper, an FBI man who’d spent years watching the *Murphys, a couple based in New Jersey, attempted to make headway with the wife, *Cynthia: I tried to talk to her about the kids, make sure she knew that we were taking care of the kids, that we were setting them up with friends. She wouldn't budge, she was cold, she gave me the ‘I understand what you’re doing, I understand your job, but I think I’m going to talk to an attorney’. Cold. That was it.

At Yasenovo, the SVR headquarters outside Moscow, these dread bits of news came in one after another during the final days of June and first ones of July: Colonel Poteyev of Department S had disappeared, presumed defected; their American spy ring was in the bag, complete; Metsos had just got away in Cyprus, Frith had managed to flee Spain. A few other illegals remained in place (in Germany and Canada for example) but they had to assume that the entire network had been compromised. It was about as big a disaster as any of them could imagine.

Then, on 4 July, the director of the SVR got a call. It was Leon Panetta, Director of the CIA.

‘I got on the phone with my Russian counterpart, Mikhail Fradkov, who was right out of central casting for a Russian spy,’ Panetta explained in a later CNN interview, ‘and I put him on speakerphone and I said, "Mikhail, I want you to know that we’re aware that they’re your people." I looked around the room and you know, our people were waiting for what Fradkov would say because there was this silence. And then Fradkov said, "Yes they are our people." And you could see all these jaws drop in the room at the fact that he was acknowledging that they were Russian spies. I said, "Look, we would like to work out an exchange," and he agreed to those next steps.’
It was game on. The question for the CIA was: if there was going to be a swap, who did they want in return? The aftershocks of this sudden reversal for Russian intelligence were felt in many places. They even reached IK 5, that labour camp in Mordovia, where a GRU colonel was barely halfway through his sentence.

Chapter 15 - Deliverance

While business went on in the Fort, back in Russia Prime Minister Vladimir Putin went to a party to celebrate the return of the SVR’s illegals. As he left, a group of journalists asked him questions. Was it true he’d been singing karaoke with them? Not quite, they had sung a song together called ‘Where Does the Motherland Begin’ and some similar numbers. This tune first featured in a 1968 series called The Sword and the Shield, which extolled the heroism of the Soviet secret police.

Putin then quoted President Medvedev, saying that the compromise of this agent network was the result of treachery, adding, ‘and traitors always come to no good, they end up in a ditch either drunk or on drugs. The other day one such traitor kicked the bucket, exactly like that, abroad.’ One of the reporters, almost egging on the former FSB chief, asked whether these traitors living abroad wouldn’t be punished. ‘I think it’s an improper question,’ Putin answered, ‘and such decisions are not made at a press conference. Intelligence agencies have their own code, and all their staff follow it.’

No doubt there was something uniquely infuriating to Putin, a one-time Department S man, about Poteyev’s betrayal of the deep-cover network. The resources involved were so enormous in creating it, and the personal sacrifices made by the Russian officers serving as illegals could hardly be imagined.

A few months later, when asked again about treachery at an end-of-year press conference, he returned to the theme of treason, but in a more general way, making a statement that clearly went beyond Poteyev and the American spy ring. While denying that Russia still has assassination squads, he still predicted a grim end for those who’d betrayed the Motherland: ‘With regard to traitors they will kick the bucket on their own, I assure you,’ Putin seemed to promise, noting, ‘Whatever thirty pieces of silver those people may have gotten, they will stick in their throat.'

[Excerpt]

Chapter 19 - Highly Likely Russia

For some, using an exotic method of assassination – polonium with Litvinenko and Novichok with the Skripal attempt – was axiomatic to Putin’s purpose. It was a deliberate signal, aimed both at people within his own intelligence agencies and to the wider public, that treachery would never be forgiven, and a way of making a statement of Russian power and impunity. Dan Hoffman, in 2010 the CIA Moscow station chief who had assisted with Skripal’s journey to the West, told me in a BBC interview:

It’s not a new strategy for Russia, for the breadcrumbs, so to speak, to lead back to the Kremlin. Part of this is revenge, but the bigger part of this is about delivering a message to Russians inside Russia, to Putin’s own electorate in advance of the elections, and to his security services who are enabling him to remain in power.

In sending a message, who was more deserving, more despised in Putin’s Russia, than a traitor? Here too we see a traditional chekist imperative, of liquidating one who had betrayed the Motherland, a tactic that had faded away during the years after the fall of communism but come back with a vengeance under Putin and arguably intensified still further since Litvinenko’s murder. For those taking the ‘trail of breadcrumbs’ interpretation, the choice of the Novichok A234 agent as poison was intended as a deliberate Russian fingerprint. And here, while acknowledging the many differences from Litvinenko’s murder, one can see a point of similarity: if the aim is to send a message the choice of a very rare poison such as polonium or A234 is a useful way of doing it.

Those who wanted to dispatch traitors to send political signals needed to find victims, though. In this matter, the Western analysts knew, there was evidence that Putin’s agencies were keeping tabs on people who were suitable targets overseas, trying to fix their whereabouts and pattern of life, while a vigorous public-information campaign kept their names alive, but despised, for the Russian public.

There can be little doubt that Alexander Poteyev, the SVR colonel who betrayed Russia’s illegal network in America, would be near the top of any Kremlin list of targets – the damage arising from his disclosures was surely greater than Skripal’s. His work for the Americans had moved Putin to public fury in 2010 with his ‘traitors will kick the bucket’ remarks. But since his exfiltration, Poteyev had been carefully looked after in the US by the FBI. How to track him down?

‘According to certain information’, Interfax news agency reported from Moscow on 7 July 2016, ‘Poteyev died in the USA. At the moment, the information is being verified.’ The news of his death was quickly picked up by Western newspapers and the story travelled around the world. If the Russians wanted to kill Poteyev, who was sixty-four by this time, it would appear to have been too late.

Except Poteyev wasn’t dead, and I was told while writing this book that he is still very much with us. What’s more, the Americans believed that the Interfax story was planted as part of a plot. Russian intelligence would monitor the communications of his friends and family in the hope that their reactions to the news story revealed something about the defector’s whereabouts. If they really hit the jackpot, Poteyev might even send a message himself of the ‘I am still very much alive’ variety and provide a way of finding him.

A few weeks after I learnt about the Poteyev ‘fake death’ plot, the Ukrainian SBU used the same ploy, albeit more elaborately, with Russian exile journalist Arkady Babchenko. Here too, we learned, the aim was to intercept online chatter that might be triggered by the ‘fake news’.

What the Poteyev case shows was not just the ongoing Russian effort to pinpoint traitors but also why, when faced with difficulties in going after their top targets, they might have moved down the list a little to someone that was easier to find. Sergei had never hidden himself. He was on the Salisbury electoral roll – unlike Litvinenko and Gordievsky, who used British aliases provided by the UK agent-resettlement people. And there was another thing that made him easier to find: his communications with Yulia and Sasha when they were back in Russia.

"The attempted assassination of a Russian spy defector"
Mark Urban
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHBwnfE0pN8
October 2, 2018

Colonel Alexander Poteyev is a mythic spy, this one grainy image being the best one we have. Poteyev was run for more than a decade by the Americans. He helped them neutralize an entire network of deep-cover Russian spies, the very people, in fact, who were arrested by the FBI, and swapped on the tarmac of Vienna airport for four Russians, including Sergei Skripal in 2010. The CIA extracted Poteyev from Russia just before those FBI arrests went down. His whereabouts ever since, a closely-guarded secret.

Welcoming the nine Russian agents home, Poteyev's betrayal of the network blew Vladimir Putin to public anger.

  Journalist: You mean, that you know the traitors by names?
  Putin: Of course, we do.
  Journalist: And you aren't going to punish them in any way, are you? You think they'll just somehow--
  Putin: I think it's an improper question, and such decisions are not made at a press conference. Intelligence agencies have their own code, and all their staff follow it.

Last month, the New York Times revealed that a Russian hitman had been detected in Florida trying to target a defector. The paper did not name the target. However, News Night has established that it was indeed former Colonel Alexander Poteyev. 

And there's more. While researching my book on Sergei Skripal, I discovered that there had been an elaborate Russian intelligence information operation designed to track down the whereabouts of Poteyev.

In July 2016, the Interfax News Agency ran a story saying, "According to certain information, Poteyev died in the USA. At the moment, the information is being verified." It was picked up by newspapers around the world. There was just one problem: it was untrue. Planted, I've heard, in the hope that Poteyev would email or phone his friends or family member in Russia to contradict the fake news story, and that this might give Russian agencies an email account or phone to hack.

So, well before Sergei Skripal was targeted in Salisbury, there was strong suggestions of attempts by Russian intelligence on former defectors, both from the information operation, and the revelation that a suspected Russian hitman was tracked in Florida.

Tom Tugendhat MP: There are many people, thank goodness, who see the evil that is going on in the Kremlin today, and reject it and so cooperate with outside forces, including the United Kingdom in order to stand up on behalf of the Russian people. And I think that their courage should be celebrated, and we should do as much as we can to protect them. But there are all so many that it is difficult to be certain, unless there is specific intelligence targeting any one of them.

So, any issue arising from the Russian attempts to target Poteyev, is did the Americans agencies share that with their partners in their country? I'm hearing that they did. And that prompts a further question: If British intelligence knew about the attempts to hit a Russian spy in America, did they do anything to improve the security of Sergei Skripal? That one's proving harder to get answers to.

As the government moves to learn lessons from the Skripal poisoning saga, the question of whether he was properly protected will not go away. In fact, the questions are likely to multiply.

"This Russian Double-Agent Is A Lot Less Dead Than He Seemed"
Alex Campbell, Jason Leopold, Heidi Blake

October 3, 2018

At 10:30 a.m. on Oct. 9, 2016, a 64-year-old master spy and known scourge of the Kremlin ambled into a Walmart in Florida and acquired a recreational fishing license.

For the right to fish along the saltwater shoreline, Alexander Poteyev disclosed his real name and date of birth, as well as a phone number, email, and mailing address — an odd choice, because Poteyev was hiding from Russian assassins.

Moscow had outed Poteyev as a traitor who exposed a network of undercover agents, including the glamorous Anna Chapman, before he defected to the US in 2010. A few years later, according to news accounts and US intelligence sources, a suspected Kremlin hit man approached his home. Then, in July 2016, Russian state TV declared that Poteyev had died. But in fact, he was very much alive.

The Kremlin crushes traitors. That promise, central to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s image, is backed up by a grim and growing list of enemies who have died or fallen ill in suspicious circumstances — most recently the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in England. By publicizing a turncoat’s death (real or otherwise), the Kremlin could claim a public relations victory while sending a warning to anyone considering similar actions. The BBC reported earlier this week on another possible incentive for the disinformation: The news might smoke the target out by prompting him to reach out to his relatives back home.

The bizarre case of Poteyev, however, also illuminates a rare moment in the spy-vs.-spy annals of international relations — a moment when US intelligence chose to support Russian propaganda.

BuzzFeed News first started reporting on Poteyev last year for a series of articles on UK and US deaths that intelligence sources suspect were Russian hit jobs. After discovering that Poteyev was in fact still alive, the reporters approached the CIA for comment. Officials there requested that the information not be published, on the grounds that revealing his name or personal details would increase the threat to Poteyev’s life, and BuzzFeed News agreed.

The officials said that allowing Moscow’s triumphal claims of a traitor’s death to go unchallenged — and thus allowing their vulnerable asset to maintain a low profile — was the best way to ensure his safety.

But that plan depended on the truth not leaking out — and on Poteyev keeping his own identity under wraps.

The BBC reported that Poteyev’s whereabouts have been a "closely-guarded secret" ever since he arrived in the US. Yet the fishing license and other public records suggest that, to the contrary, Poteyev has lived openly under his own name. The date of birth given for the fishing license — applied for just three months after his death was announced — matches a date of birth given in earlier Russian media accounts. He gave his middle name as "Nick," which appears to be an anglicization of his known Russian second name, Nikolaevich.

Around this time, Poteyev also registered to vote in the 2016 election as a Republican, again giving personal details that match the Russian defector. (Records indicate that he voted, although who he voted for is confidential.) In public records, he has given an address of a property that is easily traced to a family member.

For such a high-value international target, this is a remarkable degree of exposure. It’s unclear why he’s living so openly, but intelligence sources said it was his choice. That’s a big risk, akin to dangling "a goat in tiger country," as Mark Galeotti, an expert in Russia’s security services, told BuzzFeed News last year.

Last month, the New York Times reported that American spies had scrambled to protect a Russian defector after a suspected assassin had approached his house and traveled to a city where his relatives lived. This week, the BBC named Poteyev as that endangered defector, still very much alive despite his 2016 obituaries. Intelligence sources confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Poteyev is indeed that defector.

Federal law enforcement provides round-the-clock protection not just to Poteyev but to a group of Russian defectors in the US, all of whom American intelligence believe are being hunted by Vladimir Putin’s assassins.

Each year, the US government takes in up to 100 defectors, many of them Russian, under its PL110 resettlement program.

They typically get new names and passports to protect their identities, as well as assistance encrypting their communications, finding jobs and schools, arranging psychiatric support if needed. In some cases, the US government may even offer them plastic surgery to make them less recognizable. In a handful of cases where defectors are judged to be under "direct threat" from the Kremlin, the government also provides 24-hour guards.

Kremlin spies have in recent years found a number of Russian informants who had relocated to the United States, according to the Times; in response, counterintelligence officials conducted a "wide-reaching review" to find ways to improve the security of these individuals.

Previously, US officials had believed that the Kremlin would not go so far as to target defectors on American soil. Yet one death in America has already raised alarms. Vladimir Putin’s former media czar Mikhail Lesin was found dead in his Washington, DC, hotel room in 2015 with blunt force trauma to the head, neck, legs, arms, and torso.

Authorities announced that the death was an alcohol-related accident. But multiple current and former FBI agents and intelligence officials told BuzzFeed News last year that he was bludgeoned to death on the eve of a planned interview with officials from the Department of Justice, who had invited him to Washington to discuss the inner workings of the Kremlin-funded network Russia Today. Additionally, Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer and the author of the famous Trump dossier, provided a secret report to the FBI asserting that Lesin was bludgeoned to death by thugs hired by an oligarch close to Putin. The CIA has declined to comment on Lesin’s death.

Until recently, it seemed that Poteyev had joined Lesin on the lengthy list of Russians who fell afoul of Putin and then died unexpectedly. But what really happened is more surprising.

In 2000, Poteyev earned a coveted position with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, according to Russian media reports: deputy head of the ultra-secretive department known as Directorate S. His department oversaw a network of spies inside the United States who were playing a very long game.

After extensive training abroad, the agents arrived in the US under fake identities. Working in pairs and posing as married couples, their aim was to blend into their surroundings perfectly. They bought homes in leafy suburbs, took vanilla day jobs — travel agent, financial planner, college professor — and even raised families.

One younger agent, Anna Kushchyenko, took a slightly different tack. She presented herself as Russian but married a British man and took his surname, becoming Anna Chapman. She moved to Manhattan, a block away from Wall Street, and posed as the CEO of an international real estate company called PropertyFinder Ltd.

Chapman’s Russian handler went by the name of Roman. They communicated only on Wednesdays, and never face-to-face. Instead, she would bring her laptop with her to a public place, such as Macy’s or Barnes & Noble. Roman would pull up nearby, sometimes in a white minivan. Once he was within range, the two would get on the same encrypted wireless network and send each other messages. Then Roman would disappear, and Chapman would continue about her day. Other agents deployed more old-school Cold War spycraft tactics: dead drops, brush passes, ciphers.

Poteyev’s department ran the network from Moscow. He was born in Belarus at the tail end of the Stalin era, and his father was a war hero who won the Soviet Union’s most prestigious honor for destroying nine Nazi tanks during World War II, according to a Russian security services website. After graduating from the KGB academy in Minsk, Poteyev added to the family medal collection with a Red Star for his efforts fighting for an elite unit known as "Zenit" during Russia’s long and bloody war in Afghanistan. After the Soviet Union crumbled, Poteyev climbed the ranks of the Foreign Intelligence Service. For a time in the 1990s, he was posted to the US.

His new position had him back in Moscow, where bosses sent instructions to their agents in America through coded messages. One 2009 missive to two agents laid bare their ultimate objective: "Your education, bank accounts, car, house etc. — All these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, i.e. to search and develop ties in policymaking circles in US."

They were getting close. The agent posing as a financial planner had started to build a work relationship with a prominent New York financier who was a personal friend of a US cabinet official. Moscow was pleased, replying, "Of course he is very interesting ‘target.’" Perhaps he could pass along remarks about American foreign policy, headquarters suggested, or rumors about internal White House affairs. "Try to build up little by little relations with him."

Then one Saturday morning in June 2010, Anna Chapman got a phone call from Roman requesting an urgent meeting. At a coffee shop in downtown Manhattan that afternoon, he gave her an assignment to hand off a fake passport to another agent the next morning. Chapman was to go to a grassy location and hold up a particular magazine so that the other agent would recognize her. Roman explained the code they would use: "She will ask you, ‘Excuse me, but haven’t we met in California last summer?’ And you will say to her, ‘No, I think it was the Hamptons.’"

The rendezvous spooked Chapman. Not only did it violate Roman’s rules — communicate only on Wednesdays, and never in person — but the new assignment was much bolder than any that had come before. She called her father, an official in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to relay her concerns.

Her instincts were right: The man she met with was not the real Roman, but rather an undercover FBI agent. But it was too late. The Americans were listening in on her call with her father, and the next day agents swooped in, arresting Chapman and nine other Directorate S agents around Washington, New York, and Boston.

It soon emerged that the FBI had tracked the spy network for years as part of "Operation Ghost Stories," codenamed after the spies’ tendency to assume identities of the dead. Two weeks later, the spies pled guilty in a federal court in Manhattan and were whisked away to Russia in what became known as the largest spy swap in history, done speedily in part to preserve the Obama administration’s delicate plans to "reset" relations with Moscow.

The extensive Western news coverage made the most of the story, and in particular the red-haired Chapman’s looks. Tabloids plastered pictures of her across their front pages, with headlines such as "The Spy Who Loved Us" and "‘Red’ Head." On late-night TV television Jay Leno asked Vice President Joe Biden, "Do we have any spies that hot?" Biden replied, "It was not my idea to send her back." (Chapman has since become a model and television presenter, and the Directorate S program has inspired the award-winning television series The Americans.)

As Americans gloated, in Moscow the focus was on who blew the illegals’ covers. That fall, Russian media quoted intelligence sources naming the culprit: Alexander Poteyev. The Americans had reportedly recruited Poteyev years ago, and used what he told them to mount a counteroperation.

Russian journalists soon built a detailed account of his escape. Right as the FBI was plotting the arrests of Chapman and the other illegals, these reports said, Poteyev asked his bosses for an impromptu vacation and boarded a train to Minsk. From there he went to Ukraine, where he acquired a fake passport with the last name of Dudochkin. Then he made it to a CIA apartment in Frankfurt, before finding his way to America.

Vladimir Putin deplored the double cross in a television interview. "The man betrayed his friends, comrades in arms, and the people who sacrificed their lives for the motherland!" Putin said. "And here we have a brute who betrays such people! How can he look into the eyes of his children? Pig."

The next year, a military court held a trial by absentia during which Poteyev was convicted of treason and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In court, the judge read out a text message that he said Poteyev had sent his wife: "try to take it calmly. I am leaving not for some time, but forever. I didn’t want to, but I had to. I am starting a new life, and I will try to help the children."

By the time of his conviction, Poteyev was apparently long gone, off to start life anew in the country he had served as double agent. Sometime after he settled in the US, the Russian hit man arrived at his home, according to the recent New York Times and BBC stories. The Times reported that he "and at least one other former C.I.A. asset" later moved somewhere else, with the help of the CIA’s National Resettlement Operations Center.

According to the Times, that incident occurred "about four years ago." A couple of years after that, an announcer on Russian state media crowed that Poteyev had met a "sorry end," becoming one more example of how "life punishes traitors."

Yet the report was curiously short of details, such as where he lived or how he died. This fueled speculation among Moscow’s national security establishment. "I’m still inclined to think that this death was caused by constant stress," former FSB director Nikolai Kovalev told the news agency RIA Novosti. "Nobody needed him," said another former intelligence agent, Igor Morozov, "so to work out an operation to eliminate him would be too great an honour for Poteyev." A former KGB colonel called Poteyev a "swamp louse."

The American media barely covered the news of his apparent death. One article did quote a theory from a historian named Andrei Soldatov, who said that the Americans probably passed news of Poteyev’s death along to relatives still living in Russia, and the government had intercepted the communication. "Then the Russian secret services decided to seize the opportunity to send a message," Soldatov said, "that it always ends badly when you defect."

Poteyev’s name joined the growing list of enemies of Putin’s government who had died in recent years. A front-page article in the New York Times in August 2017 cited his reported death as one of many examples of the dark trend.

The day after that article ran, Poteyev left the first big clue that he was still very much alive.

In March of last year, BuzzFeed News put the name "Alexander Poteyev" into public records databases. The searches turned up exactly one man by that name in the United States, and it was clear that there had been little trace of this person until recently. There were addresses in Massachusetts, Arizona, and Virginia going back to October 2010, three months after the news of Directorate S broke. But if he did indeed live in those places, he was renting — and doing little else that would kick up a trail.

That changed in 2016. In January, he was pulled over in a Lexus and given a traffic ticket. Then, after he was supposed to have died, he left a trail of public breadcrumbs: He registered to vote in August, got his fishing license in October, and voted in November.

The obvious question: Was this Alexander Poteyev the double agent, or some other Alexander Poteyev? Most of the original Russian news accounts said he was born on March 7, 1952, though a couple said it was March 3 of that year. His middle name was "Nikolaievich."

Documents in Florida matched this biography. For both his traffic ticket and his voter registration Poteyev gave a date of birth of March 7, 1952. The middle name he gave was "Nick," an apparent Americanization of "Nikolaievich." Public records showed an email address and phone number linked to his name, but attempts to reach him in those ways were unsuccessful.

His home address was for a property registered to a relative. Another apartment in the complex is registered to another family member. So one day last spring BuzzFeed News approached the front desk of an apartment complex and asked to visit Poteyev. The concierge on duty declined, saying that an "Alex" lived at that address but typically came down to the lobby only if he was expecting someone. On a later visit, a different concierge allowed a reporter upstairs, accompanied by a building security guard. An older woman opened the door. Asked whether Alexander Poteyev was available, she replied, "And who are you?" Hearing that her visitor was a journalist, she immediately shut the door, saying, "No, no, no."

On a subsequent visit, the concierge called up to the apartment and a male voice answered the phone. The concierge hung up and declared that Alex did not want to speak with BuzzFeed News. Alex was not in Florida, the concierge reported. He wouldn’t be back until the following spring.

BuzzFeed News also visited the apartment of one of his relatives. Again, a concierge called up to the apartment but this time handed over the phone. Hearing that it was a journalist from BuzzFeed News, the family member asked whether this was about the "crazy stories," but agreed to pass a phone number to Poteyev. "I’ll get back to you," the family member said, and hung up. Subsequent requests for comment, including a recent one, went unanswered. 

Chapter 25 - The Voice of the Mole
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f-_dgqSppM

On November 4th, after two failed efforts in Moscow, the third attempt to obtain the file was successful.
As Mr. Pim had promised, he showed up at the designated rendezvous, and handed over the file.
The precious file arrived in Washington in several carefully-wrapped packages, enough to fill a medium-sized suitcase.
It was guarded every step of the way from on its secret journey from Moscow to the FBI.
Mr. Pim had insisted that one package be marked DO NOT OPEN, and that it be held until he himself was safely out of Moscow.
The FBI did not know why Shcherbakov had mysteriously marked the package this way.
Although the counterintelligence agents were itching to see what was inside, it was decided to abide by his instructions.
The mystery package was not opened.
In less than two weeks, they knew, the Russian would come out of Moscow and explain the contents.
The file contained the all-important notebook in which Shcherbakov had copied all of the mole's dealing with the KGB, and later the SVR, over a period of ten years.
While the agents waited for Mr. Pym to arrive, there was work to be done.
At the FBI laboratory on the third floor of FBI headquarters, the techs began a detailed forensic examination of the file.
The contents were carefully dusted for fingerprints, but there were no useful prints.
In addition, every document, message, letter, and envelope was photographed.
There were translations needed, because much of the material was in Russian.
Shcherbakov had managed to compile an inventory and description in Russian of every document -- 6,000 pages in all -- that had been passed to Moscow by the mole.
The list would have to be translated back into English.
The file included the communications exchanged by the mole and the Russians over the course of ten years, and the titles of the documents he had given to the KGB.
But the detailed notes taken by Shcherbakov described them in sufficient detail, so that the FBI could retrieve them from its own files, as well as in some cases, from the files of the NSA and the CIA.
The counterintelligence agents then began the painstaking job of matching the titles of the documents in Shcherbakov's notebook with the originals in the FBI files.
A preliminary look at the files offered some tantalizing clues to the identity of the mole, but nothing conclusive.
More was needed.
Next, FBI analysts began a thorough examination of the file, searching for clues that would confirm the identity of the mole at last.
The letters and contents nowhere identified the mole by name or by organization.
He was referred to as "Ramon", or "B", or "Ramon Garcia".
Nevertheless, the counterintelligence agents believed that Gray Deceiver, the CIA officer Brian Kelley, would soon be arrested.
Ten days after handing the file to the CIA, the seven million dollar spy made it back to the U.S. for the last time.
On November 14th, Mr. Pym was in Washington, meeting with Rochford and other FBI counterintelligence agents.
As instructed, the FBI had not opened the envelope marked DO NOT OPEN.
"Now," Shcherbakov said. "Open it. There's a fingerprint of your guy on a bag, and a voice recording."
It was 14 years earlier, in 1986, that the unidentified mole had given the KGB the number of a pay phone in Northern Virginia that he arranged to call at an agreed time. 
On August 18th, unknown to the mole, the KGB agent who answered recorded part of their conversation.
Now, the FBI had the tape.
The Russians had kept everything, even one of the plastic trash bags that the mole had used to wrap the documents that he left for the KGB in dead drops around Washington.
Mr. Pym explained how he came to possess the bag inside the mystery package.
In addition to the tape recording, was an ordinary black plastic trash bag, of the kind that suburban homeowners used to dispose of leaves or garbage.
When Hanson filled a dead drop, he would wrap the documents and disks in a plastic trash bag and tape it up to waterproof it, and protect it from the elements.
Then he would wrap the whole package in a second plastic bag.
Under normal procedure, Mr. Pym said someone else opened the bags.
He would then receive a pile of documents that had been handled first by others.
Only once did they drop off the outer bag with the documents.
He said when he removed the outer bag, he assumed that the only person who had touched the inner bag was himself and Ramon.
So he carefully put the inner bag in an envelope.
The plastic bag was to prove one of the two crucial items in the file that Shcherbakov removed from the KGB's first chief Directorate, it's foreign espionage arm.
The other was the tape recording.
The bag was sent to the FBI lab to check for fingerprints, but the bag would have to be handled with extreme care, and processing it for prints was going to take a while.
In the meantime, Rochford, with two colleagues Michael Waguespack and Tim Bereznay, turned to a room in the basement of the FBI to listen to the tape.
Waguespack, known as Wagues, grew up in the Cajun country near New Orleans, and was regarded as one of the best counterintelligence agents in the FBI.
Bereznay a was also an experienced counterintelligence agent, and a section chief at FBI headquarters.
Now, at last, Rochefort was sure the fate of Gray Deceiver, Brian Kelley, was sealed.
The FBI counterintelligence agents were still convinced that the CIA officer was the mole.
As the FBI agents settled back to listen, they were sure they were about to hear the voice of Brian Kelley.
The tape rolled, and the FBI agents could hardly wait to hear it.
The long mole hunt was about to be over.
To their utter consternation, the voice that boomed out from the speakers was not that of Brian Kelley.
The agents were stunned and chagrined at the unexpected turn of events.
Three years lost.
All that effort, and now, just as Rochford was sure that the mole was within his grasp, the shocking revelation: on a 14-year old snippet of magnetic tape that the bureau had been chasing the wrong man.
Brian Kelley was innocent.
His career at the CIA had suffered great damage that could not be undone and repaired.
But if the voice on the tape was not Brian Kelley, then who was it?
Waguespack recalled his frustration.
"I kept listening, and I said, 'I know that voice. The inflection. I know that voice, but I can't put it with anybody. That voice sounds familiar. We broke off that day, still unsure."

Chapter 26 - Oh, My God!
https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=U28glpXzDp8

There had been a big meeting at the FBI's Washington field office to try to figure out the voice on the tape, but it reached no conclusion.
Afterwards, Bob King and Jim Milburn, the FBI's two veteran Soviet analysts, were walking back together to headquarters.
The more he looked at the case, Milburn said, the more he thought the mole worked for the FBI, not the CIA.
Not only that, Milburn concluded from the contents of the file that the mole served in an FBI analytical unit, not one of the operational divisions.
And most of the material in the file dealt with the Soviets.
Jim suddenly wrote on a tiny piece of paper: "Hanssen?" 
King firmly disagreed.
"I said, 'There's just no way. He has a wife and kids, and he's more Catholic than the Pope. Hanssen just did not fit the profile of a mole. I'd met his family and several of his children. I'd been to his house.'"
The two analysts had come to know Hanssen well when he supervised the mole study the three had conducted to see if older FBI cases might provide clues to the current traitor.
Hanssen did seem notably religious.
The analysts knew he slipped off to Mass almost every day.
Back at headquarters, after the short walk from the field office, King and Milburn adjourned to their office in the vault, a v-shaped windowless storage room on the fourth floor that had been converted to a secure office.
The door could only be opened by a digital combination lock.
Sensitive materials were kept in a safe, inside the vault, and mole investigations were run there.
It was out of the way on an inside corridor, which had the added advantage of shielding it from the questions of other counterintelligence agents, curious about what was going on in the vault.
The two analysts talked over what was known so far.
The voice on tape was still a mystery.
Mr. Pym did not know his identity, but had offered some additional fragments.
"Before he brought out the file from Moscow," King said, "he had already told us some things tidbits that were in it. One tidbit only added to the puzzle. When the Russians asked for the name of someone whom they could approach as a possible recruitment, the mole offered up the name of Jack Horschauer."
The name initially did not ring a bell with either analyst.
"Who was Jack Horschauer?" Milburn asked.
King thought back to the time that he and Milburn had worked on the study of past efforts to penetrate the FBI. 
Twelve years earlier, for several months in 1988, the two analysts and their supervisor had worked on the mole study in room 4835, a cramped cubicle at headquarters.
The supervisor was Robert Hanssen.
"Hanssen had often referred to his friend, Jack, from Germany," King remembered. "He was always talking about Jack from Germany. At some point, he must have mentioned Jack's last name."
King had also seen the report that Jack Horschauer's name had been offered by the mole as someone the KGB might try to recruit.
At the time, Jack Horschauer was married and living in Germany.
He had commanded an air infantry company in Vietnam, served with the Special Forces in Germany for three years, and then as a military attache in the American Embassy in Bonn.
He retired from the service in 1994.
But none of that explained why an obscure retired Army lieutenant colonel had been singled out by the mole.
In the course of their discussion about Horschauer, and when Milburn asked, "Who is Jack Horschauer?" the answer emerged.
King realized now that Jack from Germany and Jack Horschauer were the same person.
King remembered the electric moment when the truth dawned on both of them in unison.
"We said, 'Oh, my god!'"
The two analysts had a copy of the tape in the vault.
Quickly, they spun the dial on the old-fashioned Mosler safe, pulled out the tape, and listened to it again.
Recognizing the voice before had been extremely difficult because, the tape was only two minutes long, and the mole whispered some of the time.
Without any context, identifying one voice from what might be tens of thousands was challenging.
Moreover, on the tape, the mole spoke only 41 words, along with several grunts and uh-huh's.
But the last time Milburn and King heard the tape, they had not figured out who Jack Horschauer was.
It made their task of voice recognition exponentially easier.
Now they knew the voice on the tape.
"That's Hanssen," King said.

Chapter 27: The 28th Spy

The analysts were confident they had identified the mole at last.
"The stakes were high," King said. "We could not afford to be wrong. Our credibility for anything would be gone."
In the morning, they would tell Division Five, the Intelligence Division at headquarters.
But first they would need to share their dramatic conclusion with the Washington Field Office, known inside the FBI by its initials: WFO. 
The field office was in charge of the hunt for the mole.
"Protocol was to brief WFO first," King said, "and then Division Five."
The two analysts met at WFO with Special Agent, Deborah Evans-Smith, who supervised the mole hunt as head of the espionage squad at WFO. 
Smith had studied Russian language and specialized in Russian foreign intelligence cases, first in Los Angeles, and then at WFO.
Afterwards, the analysts returned to headquarters and briefed Mike Rochford, whose dogged six-year pursuit of the mole had finally succeeded, despite the carping from many of his colleagues who said he was wasting the FBI's time and money.
He had been turned down by 27 KGB officers who spurned his million-dollar offer for information leading to the identity of the mole.
The 28th spy was Mr. Pym.
He knew the value of what he had he traded the file for: seven million dollars, and a guarantee of protection for himself and his family. 
The reputation of King and Millburn was still on the line, even after they unmasked Hanssen as the mole.
"We sent for Hanson's personnel file," King said, "in his application to the FBI. We found he had used Jack Horschauer as a reference."
Any lingering private doubts the analysts might have had were dispelled by the personnel file.
On November 22nd, Neil J. Gallagher, the FBI assistant director for intelligence, received his first briefing on the contents of the KGB file.
By that time, the two analysts had recognized Hanssen's voice on the tape.
But additional internal evidence in the file made it plain that the mole was Robert Hanssen.
Analysis of the file buttressed that conclusion.
The mole's first letter to the KGB was dated October 1st, 1985, and mailed from a Washington suburb.
Although Hanssen was then assigned to New York, FBI records showed he was in Washington on that day.
In May 1990, the mole told the Russians that he would be going on more trips.
That was the year that Hanssen traveled as an agent in the Inspection Division, including his jaunt to Hong Kong with Priscilla Sue Gailey.
In November 1991, Hanssen had been promoted to unit chief at higher pay.
A month later, he told the KGB he had received a salary increase and more authority.
There were several references to Chicago Hanssen's birthplace.
Now Hanssen was the FBI's target, with a new codename: Gray Day.
Mr. Pym was safely in the U.S.
Some members of his family had also gotten out, and the seven million dollars was his, to be paid over a period of time.
Checking the plastic bag for fingerprints was not completed until mid-December.
Two latent fingerprints were found on the bag.
They belonged to Robert Phillip Hansen.
There had been little question for several weeks that the mole was indeed Robert Hanssen, but now with the fingerprints, the bureau had solid forensic evidence.
It would have been difficult for even the most skilled defense lawyer to explain what Hanssen's prints were doing on a plastic bag deposited in a secret file inside the KGB in Moscow.
Although the FBI had followed a false trail for three years, because of Mike Rochford's persistence, it had pulled off an unprecedented counterintelligence feat.
Nothing like it had ever happened before.
The Bureau had engineered Mr. Pym's travel to New York, and had managed to pull off the seemingly impossible: to extract a file on the most damaging mole in the history of the FBI, from one of the most guarded buildings in Russia, the headquarters of the KGB's foreign intelligence service in Yasenevo.
