Feb 14, 2017 6:40pm
Warner: Test from Christina for call later today 
Waldman: That worked.

Feb 15, 2017 12:14pm
Waldman: Mark, I wanted to let you know that everyone I have spoken with in USG about this matter, each of whom I have also been entirely transparent with about my motives in trying to assist, has assured me that they understand and even appreciate my efforts. Perhaps that's wrong but I wanted to pass along to you. I told Assange just as I told the USG that I would end this pro bono role if I found the objective (safe passage to discuss w USG the past and future leaks) could not be achieved. Br, adam

Feb 16, 2017 10:49pm
Warner: Have had important call about ur message will have answer tomorrow
Waldman: Thank you. Standing by. Just want to underscore my opinion and the reason I got involved - this guy is going to do something catastrophic for the dems, Obama, CIA and national security. I hope someone will consider getting him to US to ameliorate the damage.

Feb 17, 2017 10:28pm
Waldman: Hey Mark - am back in Washington and hope we can get togetherh, maybe w Jack? And ourwives? Pls let me know whatever suits you. BB is also treating a small number of people if you want in on that I can arrange.....adam

Mar 30, 2017 9:20am
Waldman: Yesterday's press might have run him off. I just spoke w him and He's huddled w lawyers now and will tell me his position later in the day.
Warner: We want to do this right private in London don't want to send letter yet cuz if we can't get agreement wud rather not have paper trail
Waldman: That makes sense. Glad to keep trying to intermediate and see if I can convince him to speak w you directly. At the moment he seems spooked. No pun intended.

Mar 31, 2017 3:17pm
Warner: Keep me informed also any news from ur other guy on manafort

Mar 31, 2017 3:43pm
Waldman: My other gu, like Steeele, very mistrustful of USG. He's been essentially shut out of the country and dragged through the mud. I explored this question w him last night in person. 

Mar 31, 2017 3:53pm
Waldman: Update re the other other guy, my contact at DOJ has gone silent for 72 hrs. I gave him what he asked for and now don't hear from him. Please let me know if you can hear anything. Will keep trying until I sense there is no appetite on either side for resolution. Interesting, just heard from DOJ that they received and are considering.

Apr 5, 2017 4:53pm
Warner: Any word on Steele
Waldman: Yes. Seems to have cold feet from the leaks. Said he wanted a bi partisan letter followed by written questions.

Apr 6, 2017 7:21am
Waldman: Morning Mark. People I know at WSJ just called me and said they heard from senate intel comm that the committee and Steele are speaking through an intermediary and they also asked if they intermediary was me.

Apr 6, 2017 8:46am
Warner: Don't know how they wud get that I wud my comment
Waldman: I said don't know anything about it

Apr 6, 2017 2:31pm
Waldman: When is Manafort testifying? That could have some bearing on other opportunities.

Apr 7, 2015 8:15am
Warner: Haven't decided we need to review intel first

Apr 10, 2017 11:11am
Warner: Any news. On any front

Apr 10, 2017 11:18am
Hi. Steele: would like to get a bi partisan letter from the committee; Assange: I convinced him to make serious and important concessions and am discussing those w DOJ; Deripaska: willing to testify to congress but interested in state of play w Manafort. I will be w him next tuesday for a week.

Apr 10, 2017 11:39am
Waldman: I'm bringing Ben Stiller for a day of Hill and Administration meetings on refugee issues in May. Would you like me to bring him by your office?

Apr 10, 2017 11:56am
Warner: Sure

Apr 11, 2017 4:31am
Waldman: Mark call me anytime you want to discuss the above 3. I am glad to communicate or try to accomplish whatever you want to do.

Apr 18, 2017 6:23pm
Warner: Been off grid for a few days need to get up with u this week on phone

Apr 19, 2017 1:10am
Waldman: Hey, Great please let me know when. I'm 9 time zones ahead of you.

Apr 19, 2017 9:46am
Warner: Where r u
Waldman: Maldives

Apr 20, 2017 12:17pm
Warner: Sorry. Been traveling today how late r u up
Waldman: Hey mark. I'm at a client dinner. I could step out now?

Apr 20, 2017 3:12pm
Waldman: Hey just tried you

Apr 20, 2017 4:18pm
Warner: U still up

Apr 22, 2017 2:22am
Waldman: Hey mark I'm 9 hours ahead of you. Please give me a shout whenever you're up and it's convenient.

Apr 22, 2017 3:49pm
Warner: U must be asleep

Apr 22, 2017 11:01pm
Waldman: I'm up now

Apr 23, 2017 10:06am
Warner: Will call on my way to NYC
Waldman: Ok if we miss I head back to munich tomorrow and land at 3 pm your time. We could also speak when I'm back in Europe. I'm also in Canada and then Washington from 28.

Apr 25, 2017 12:22am
Waldman: I spoke w Steele. He repeated the same position which is that he wants to be helpful but is fearful of the triumvirate of cost, time suck and reputation. He asked me what your concern was about a letter first and I explained it but he would still like as a first protective step from you and Burr asking him and his partner to assist w the investigation by answering questions. He said he will also speak w Dan Jones whom he says is talking to you. I pointed out there is no privilege in that discussion although Dan is a good and very trustworthy guy. I encouraged him again to engage with you for the sake of the truth and of vindication of the dossier. Pls call anytime w additional thought you want me to communicate. Perhaps a compromise that just occurred to me would be to ask and get answered by him (through me, orally and only between the three of us) what you want to know up front to give you certainty you are looking for a pre-letter.

Apr 25, 2017 8:24am
Warner: Seems very weird that he won't do a call. What wud a letter do to deal with his concerns. Maybe I will just call directly

Apr 25, 2017 8:36am
Waldman: He thinks a letter means he is being formally requested by a non-partisan investigative body to answer question to assist that body's investigation.

Apr 25, 2017 8:58am
Warner: Gotta tell u makes no sense he won't do a call first tell him call will be only ten minutes

Apr 25, 2017 9:18am
Waldman: I just talked to Chris again. I can't convince him to do a call first. He is under a lot of duress FYI. He said Dan Jones is coming to see you. I suggest you explain to Dan why a call is the necessary first step rather than a letter from your perspective.

May 11, 2017 10:05am
Waldman: Mark do you have time to pop by for a dirnk today after work? We are having a small number of friends over. Might be good to see each other live before I leave for ny (then LA then Europe) some time next week. We are getting enquiries for Deripaska relating to M from multiple directions. Ps I rented the Rapppaport house for July so will be a few beaches down from you this summer.

May 12, 2017 11:29am
Hey Mark - please let me know if you want to discuss. My Russian client asked me to engage in specific way w investigation. We received letter from counsel of house intel committee. I assume you want me to deal with you rather than him but please let me know. Glad to meet you in person too (but I leave Tuesday). Warmest adam

May 15, 2017 5:47am
Waldman: Hey Mark - Do you want to discuss Deripasksa or should I respond to the house intel committee instead?
